				<Paragraph>For many  calculations you use a calculator. The main aim of this unit is to help you to do this in a sensible and fruitful way. Using a calculation to solve a problem involves four main stages:</Paragraph>
				<UnNumberedList>
<ListItem><Paragraph>Stage 1: working out what calculation you want to do;</Paragraph></ListItem>
<ListItem><Paragraph>Stage 2: working out roughly what size of answer to expect from your calculation;</Paragraph></ListItem>
<ListItem><Paragraph>Stage 3: carrying out the calculation;</Paragraph></ListItem>
<ListItem><Paragraph>Stage 4: interpreting the answer – Does it agree with the rough estimate? Does it make sense in terms of the original problem?</Paragraph></ListItem>
</UnNumberedList>
<Paragraph>This unit focuses on Stages 2 and 4<!--, in preparation for using your calculator-->.</Paragraph>
		</Introduction>
		<LearningOutcomes>
			<Paragraph>By the end of this unit you should be able to:</Paragraph>
			<LearningOutcome>round a given whole number to the nearest 10, 100, 1000 and so on;</LearningOutcome>
			<LearningOutcome>round a decimal number to a given number of decimal places or significant figures;</LearningOutcome>
			<LearningOutcome>use rounded numbers to find rough estimates for calculations;</LearningOutcome>

<Paragraph>The English mathematician Charles Babbage, father of modern computing, once wrote to Tennyson regarding one of his poems:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>‘In your otherwise beautiful poem,’ Babbage wrote, ‘one verse reads,</Paragraph>
<Verse>
	<Paragraph>Every moment dies a man,</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>Every moment one is born.</Paragraph>
</Verse>
<Paragraph>‘If this were true, the population of the world would be at a standstill. In truth, the rate of birth is slightly in excess of that of death. I would suggest:</Paragraph>
<Verse>
	<Paragraph>Every moment dies a man,</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>Every moment 1 <InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="MU120_4M2_001ie.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation><!--!nsert equation 1 1/16--> is born</Paragraph>
</Verse>
<Paragraph>‘Strictly speaking,’ Babbage added, ‘the actual figure is so long I cannot get it into a line, but I believe the figure 1 <InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="MU120_4M2_001ie.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation><!--!nsert equation 1 1/16--> will be sufficiently accurate for poetry.’</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Newspapers, magazines and television often provide numerical information such as that below.</Paragraph>
<Figure id="FIGI044"><Image id="FIGI044" src="MU120_A_I044i.jpg"/><Description/></Figure>
<Paragraph>How do you interpret the figures in the headlines above?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>It is unlikely that the monthly balance of payments deficit, for example, would be exactly £25 000 000. (Remember 25,000,000 means the same as 25 000 000.) It's more likely to be a number fairly close to £25 000 00: a number like £24 695 481 or £25 332 206. From the reader's point of view, £25 000 000 gives an idea of the size of the deficit; it's a <i>good approximation</i>. Large numbers in particular are often approximated in this way. This process is called <b>rounding</b>.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>When you use your calculator, you will need to interpret the results. Part of this interpretation is rounding the answer appropriately.</Paragraph>

<Heading>Rounding to the nearest hundred</Heading>
<Paragraph>You will probably think to yourself that the coat shown costs about £300. £290 is considerably closer to £300 than it is to £200, so £300 is a reasonable approximation. In this case, 290 has been rounded up to 300. Similarly, 208 would be rounded down to 200 because it is closer to 200 than it is to 300. Both numbers have been <i>rounded to the nearest hundred pounds</i>.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>When <i>rounding to the nearest hundred</i>, anything below fifty rounds down. So 248 rounds to 200. Anything over fifty rounds up. So 253 rounds to 300. Technically there is a problem with fifty itself as it is equidistant from the hundred above and the hundred below. Usually fifty is rounded up, so that a simple rule can be applied:</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>When <i>rounding to the nearest hundred</i> look at the tens digit:</Paragraph>
<BulletedList>
<ListItem><Paragraph>if the tens digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 round down;</Paragraph></ListItem>
<ListItem><Paragraph>if the tens digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 round up.</Paragraph></ListItem>
</BulletedList>
<Paragraph>So £284 rounds up (to £300) and £233 rounds down (to £200).</Paragraph>
</SubSubSection>
<SubSubSection id="SEC001_002_002">
<Heading>Rounding to the nearest ten</Heading>
<Paragraph>The blouse in the figure above was £19 and you may well have thought of it as roughly £20. In this case you would be <i>rounding to the nearest ten</i> (pounds).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The rule for rounding to the nearest hundred can be adapted easily to rounding to the nearest ten. Instead of looking at the tens digit look at the units digit.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>So £23 is rounded down (to £20) and £36 is rounded up (to £40).</Paragraph>
<Example id="EXA001">
<Heading>Example 1</Heading>
<Paragraph>The distance from London to Newcastle is 282 miles. Round this distance to the nearest 10 miles and the nearest hundred miles.</Paragraph>
<Answer><SubHeading>Solution</SubHeading>
<Paragraph>To round to the nearest 10, look at the units digit. This is a 2, so round down to 280 miles.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>To round to the nearest 100, look at the tens digit. This is 8, so round up to 300 miles.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Therefore the distance from London to Newcastle is 280 miles, to the nearest ten miles, and 300 miles, to the nearest hundred miles.</Paragraph>

	<Title>1.3 Rounding in general</Title>
<Paragraph>Numbers are often approximated to make them easier to handle, but sometimes it doesn’t help very much to round to the nearest 10 or the nearest 100 if the number is very large. For example, suppose the monthly balance of payments deficit was actually £24 695 481. Rounded to the nearest 10, it's £24 695 480; and to the nearest 100, it's £24 695 500. But £24 695 500 is still a complicated number to deal with in your head. That's why it was rounded to £25 000 000 in the newspaper headline. In fact numbers can be rounded to any level of accuracy – to the nearest 1000, or the nearest 10 000 or even to the nearest million (as in the newspaper headline).</Paragraph>
<Figure id="FIGI046"><Image id="FIGI046" src="MU120_A_I046i.jpg"/><Description>Text</Description></Figure>
<Paragraph>The rule for rounding can be generalised as follows.</Paragraph>
<Box id="BOX001_001">
<Heading>Rounding to the nearest….</Heading>
<Paragraph>Look at the digit to the right of the one you are rounding to:</Paragraph>
<BulletedList>
<ListItem><Paragraph>if the digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 round down;</Paragraph></ListItem>
<ListItem><Paragraph>if the digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 round up.</Paragraph></ListItem>
</BulletedList></Box>
<Paragraph>Notice that this general rule agrees with rounding to the nearest hundred (the digit to the right of the hundreds digit is the tens digit) and rounding to the nearest ten (the digit to the right of the tens digit is the units digit).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Thus, £24 695 481 rounded to the nearest 1000 is £24 695 000 and rounded to the nearest million, or 1000 000 is £25 000 000.</Paragraph>

<Caption/>
<Description/>
</Figure>
<Paragraph>Using a calculator often gives a long string of digits. For example, 1 ÷ 3 might give .333333333. But very often, for practical purposes, this level of accuracy is too precise to be useful. You try measuring .33333333 metres!</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Decimal numbers can be rounded just like whole numbers. For example, 0.33333333 is nearer to 0.3 than to 0.4 and rounding 0.33333333 m to 0.3 m makes it easy to measure. Here the number has been rounded so that it contains one decimal digit; it has been <i>rounded to one decimal place</i>. (We often write ‘d.p.’ for ‘decimal place’.)</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Often it is more sensible to measure to the nearest centimetre (0.01 m), in which case 0.3333333 m rounds to 0.33 m. Here the number contains two decimal digits; it has been <i>rounded to two decimal places</i>.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The rule for rounding applies just as well to decimal places as hundreds.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The number of decimal places given, however, indicates the accuracy. So 0.30 indicates accuracy to the nearest 0.01 (two decimal places) whereas 0.3 indicates accuracy to the nearest 0.1 (one decimal place).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph/>
<Paragraph>The general rule for rounding to a number of decimal places is to look at the digit one place to the right of the number of digits you want to round to, and round up or down depending on whether this digit is ‘5 or more’ or ‘4 or less’.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Rounding to approximate accuracy and then calculating the volume of the tank by using the formula length × width × height gives a volume of approximately 4 × 3 × 3 = 36 cubic metres. 1 cubic metre contains 1000 litres, so 36 cubic metres contains 36 × 1000 = 36 000 litres.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>If you need 2 litres per day of water then you can survive 36 000 ÷ 2 = 18 000 days before it rains. This is about 20 000 days and taking a year to be about 400 days means that you can survive about 20 000 ÷ 400 = 50 years.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The accurate answer would give 53.69 years (to 2 d.p.). You might not be too concerned to be told that you had only 50 years rather than 53.69 years to live on your deserted island if it did not rain!</Paragraph>

<Title>1.5 Significant figures</Title>
<Paragraph>Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to round to a specific number of decimal places. If, say, you were calculating the cost of fencing at £10.65 per metre, for a garden boundary, the length of which had been given to you as 185 feet, then you would want to multiply 10.65 × 185 × 0.3048. (Conversion of feet to metres was given in <CrossRef idref="EXA002">Example 2</CrossRef>.) To do the calculation quickly, you might round this to 10 × 200 × 0.3 = 600 and thus estimate the cost as about £600. (You might use this figure as a check on the exact calculation, done on a calculator.)</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>What has been done is round each of 10.65, 185, 0.3048 to <i>one significant figure</i>. (We often write ‘s.f.’ for ‘significant figures’.) Thus 10.65 is rounded to 10 (the 1 is the significant figure); 185 has been rounded to 200 (the 2 is the significant figure); and 0.3048 has been rounded to 0.3 (the 3 is the significant figure). All of these numbers contained zeros, but they were not deemed significant so far as the accuracy of the estimation was concerned. In the £600 answer, only the 6 is significant. You would expect the answer to be about six hundreds but not zero tens and zero units.</Paragraph>
<Box id="BOX001_002">
<Paragraph>The first non zero digit (from the left) in a number is the first significant figure. To round to a given number of significant figures, first count from the first significant digit to the number required (including zeros).

<BulletedList>
<ListItem><Paragraph>assume that the path of the Earth's orbit around the Sun is circular;</Paragraph></ListItem>
<ListItem><Paragraph>the distance between the Earth and the Sun is approximately 92 860 000 miles, which is the radius of the orbit;</Paragraph></ListItem>

<Heading>Example 4</Heading>
<Paragraph>In scientific work people deal with very small units of measurement. Suppose you read that the spacing between adjacent atoms in a solid was 0.000 002 456 84 metres. You could make the number more memorable by using two significant figure accuracy.</Paragraph>
<Answer><SubHeading>Solution</SubHeading>
<Paragraph>To find 0.000 002 456 84 metres correct to two significant figures, count from the first non-zero digit on the left. The first significant digit in this number is the 2. The zeros to the left of this digit are not significant but they maintain the place value of the other digits. The second significant digit is the 4 and to the right of this digit is a 5 which means round up to give 0.000 0025 metres (2 s.f.).</Paragraph>
</Answer>
</Example>
<Paragraph>You may have noticed that the word ‘significant’ has a more precise meaning in mathematics than when used in everyday language and that sometimes zeros are not counted as significant figures, even though they are obviously important in specifying the place value of a digit.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>At the beginning of <CrossRef idref="SEC001_005">Section 1.5</CrossRef> there was a £600 estimate for the cost of fencing. The zeros are necessary to indicate that the 6 represents six hundreds, rather than six tens or six units, but the fact that they are zeros (rather than another digit) is not significant (in the exact cost, it is unlikely that both would be zero). However if an exact calculation gives a cost of £609, then the zero is significant. (To tell you it is six hundred, zero tens and nine units.) This is a price quoted to three significant figures.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>For decimal numbers like 0.060 09 metres, the zeros to the left of the 6 are not considered significant (although they are important to indicate the place value), but those to the right are significant.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Approximations are most useful when it comes to making rough estimates – like adding up a bill quickly to see if it is about right or checking a calculation. When using a calculator it is very important that you have an independent means (by estimation) of judging whether your answer is correct, or at least plausible. To make a rough estimate the numbers must be easy to work with, so being able to round numbers is an extremely useful skill.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>For different purposes different degrees of approximation may be appropriate. Be careful about the level of accuracy of an estimate.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Yes, she is correct.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Note that Val has used positive numbers to represent money in hand and negative numbers to represent debts or payments due, but she could have done the reverse. Sharing among four people, she has used division by four. It is important that the total was calculated before the division by four.</Paragraph>

<Title>3.2 Have I used the correct order for my calculation?</Title>
<Paragraph>When calculating an answer it is important that you give careful consideration to the order of operations used in the calculation. If you are using a mixture of operations remember that certain operations take priority in a calculation. Consider the following, apparently, simple sum.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   1 + 2 × 3 = ?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>What answer would you give?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Did you give 7 as your response, or 9?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The correct answer is 7 but can you explain why?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>If you have a calculator handy, check that it follows the correct order. Some <!--cheap-->basic calculators do not, but scientific calculators should do so.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph><!--As explained in Section 1.3, -->Brackets come first, then powers, and then multiplication and division (working from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (working from left to right).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Consider this sum:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   10 − 5 + 3 = ?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>What answer would you give?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Did you provide 2 as your response, or 8?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The correct answer is 8 but can you explain why?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The operations of addition and subtraction belong to the same group, and so you perform the calculation from left to right. Addition does not have priority over subtraction.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Consider these calculations:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   (1 + 2) × 3 = ?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   10 − (5 + 3) = ?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>These calculations are similar to earlier ones but this time involve the use of brackets, which take priority over the other operations. The correct answers here are 9 and 2 respectively.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>There is a great variety of measurement units in use. Their incorrect use leads to errors which can sometimes be costly.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>On 23 September 1999, NASA lost a $125 million Mars orbiter. This was because an engineering team used imperial units of measurement while NASA's team used the metric system for a key spacecraft operation.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Suppose that you want to buy a carpet, priced at £16.00 per square metre, for the room shown above and you calculate the area as follows.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Area = 5 × 450 = 2250</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Cost of carpet = 16 × 2250 = £3600</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>An expensive carpet! What is wrong?</Paragraph>
<Answer><SubHeading>Solution</SubHeading>
<Paragraph>There is a mixture of units: metres and centimetres.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>If a problem has a mixture of measurement units, it is usually a good idea to convert all measures to the same units. Here the carpet is sold in units of ‘square metres’, therefore ensure all the measurements are in metres.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Hence area required = 5 × 4.50.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Area = 22.5 square metres.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Cost of carpet = £16 × 22.5 = £360.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>When using a calculator many people have ‘blind faith’ in its capacity to provide the correct result.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Calculators invariably provide the correct result for the information they are given; any errors are due to the operator.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>To help guard against errors, always give a ‘ball-park’ estimate for a problem, using rounded values and easy calculations.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>For example, make a rough estimate of the calculation below to act as a check upon the actual calculation using the calculator.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>3.421 + 5.986 + 12.009 87 = ?</Paragraph>
<!--<Equation id="UEQN024"><Image src="MU120_A_U024e.jpg" width="col_100"></Image><Description></Description></Equation>-->
<Paragraph>Rough check: 3 + 6 + 12 = 21</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Calculator answer: 21.416 87</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The two answers are within the same ‘ball-park’ so you should be happy with the calculator's answer. Had you got an answer of 3438.995 87, say, you should be suspicious and checking would reveal you had missed out a decimal point.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>It is helpful to adopt this checking strategy for all your calculations since it is so easy to press the wrong key inadvertently, or double press a key when working at speed on a calculator.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Often it is useful to have both an underestimate and an overestimate.</Paragraph>
<Figure id="FIGI052"><Image id="FIGI052" src="MU120_A_I052i.jpg"/><Description/></Figure>
<Example id="EXA011">
<Heading>Example 11</Heading>
<Paragraph>Look back at <CrossRef idref="EXA009">Example 9</CrossRef>, which gave an incorrect answer. How could you have spotted this without doing the whole calculation?</Paragraph>
<Answer><SubHeading>Solution</SubHeading>
<Paragraph>First do an overestimate, then an underestimate, per person.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>In an overestimate, ignore the float and round the food up to £40, drinks to £6, taxi £4, tip £3 minus £5 discount gives £48 this is less than £50. Divide by 5 people means the maximum share for each person is £10. Hence £10.80 is too much.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>An underestimate would be £35 for food, £5 for drinks, £3 for taxi and £3 for tip, less £5 for the voucher and £1 float. This gives £40, divided by 5, which means minimum of £8 each.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Hence you would expect an answer between £8 and £10.</Paragraph>
</Answer></Example>
<Paragraph>One common error when using a calculator is to forget that the calculator does not total everything as it goes along. So, for example, in the case of the bill for a night out, you must total everything before you divide by the number of people who are sharing the bill.</Paragraph>
<Example id="EXA012">
<Heading>Example 12</Heading>
<Paragraph>Look back at <CrossRef idref="EXA008">Example 8</CrossRef> and suppose that the calculation was put into a scientific calculator, in the following form:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>0.04 + 5.00 + 8.00 − 36.98 − 5.10 − 3.50 − 3.00 ÷ 4 = ?</Paragraph>
<!--<Equation id="UEQN025"><Image src="MU120_A_U025e.jpg" width="col_100"></Image><Description></Description></Equation>-->
<Paragraph>Would this give the right answer?</Paragraph>
<Answer><SubHeading>Solution</SubHeading>
<Paragraph>No, it would not give the right answer. The calculator will do the division first, i.e. 3.00 ÷ 4, and then all the additions and subtractions, to give the answer <sup>−</sup>32.93. And £32.93 is clearly too much for each person's share of the bill.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>In order to make it do the calculation correctly, you can either total after the 3.00, by using the ‘=’ (or ‘ENTER’) button, or use brackets.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>(0.40 + 5.00 + 8.00 − 36.98 − 5.10 − 3.50 − 3.00) ÷ 4</Paragraph>

<Question>
<Paragraph><b>3</b> Suppose a friend has worked out the price of carpeting some stairs with carpet which costs £4.50 per square metre.</Paragraph>
<Figure id="FIGI054"><Image id="FIGI054" src="MU120_A_I054i.jpg"/><Description>Text</Description></Figure>
<Paragraph>The stairs are in three flights of ten, and each step requires 25 cm for the tread and 17 cm for the rise. The stair width is nearly one metre. There are also landings to be carpeted of length 1.2 m and 5.4 m, both one metre wide. By estimating what the answer should be, and then working through what he has done, check the calculation below for your friend.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Each stair 25 + 17 = 42</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Ten stairs 42 × 10 = 420</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Three flights of stairs 420 × 3 = 1260</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Landings 1.2 + 5.4 = 6.6</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Total length 6.6 + 1260 = 1266.6</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Cost £4.50 × 1266.6 = £5699.7</Paragraph></Question>
<Answer>
<Paragraph>£5699.7 seems a lot for a stair carpet.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Estimate of answer: Length needed for one step <InlineEquation shiftby="1"><Image src="asymptotically.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation> 0.2 + 0.2 <InlineEquation shiftby="1"><Image src="asymptotically.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation>0.4m.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Length needed for 10 stairs <InlineEquation shiftby="1"><Image src="asymptotically.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation> 10 × 0.4 = 4 m</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>So length needed for 30 stairs <InlineEquation shiftby="1"><Image src="asymptotically.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation> 4 × 3 = 12 m.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Landings need <InlineEquation shiftby="1"><Image src="asymptotically.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation>1 + 6 <InlineEquation shiftby="1"><Image src="asymptotically.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation> 7m</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>So total length needed = 12 + 7 = 19 <InlineEquation shiftby="1"><Image src="asymptotically.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation> 20 m.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>So cost would be about 20 × 5 = £100 which is a lot less than £5699.70.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>The stairs are measured in cms and the landings are measured in metres. So in calculating ‘total length’ your friend has added numbers of different units. The cost of the carpet is in pounds per metre, so it is sensible to convert centimetres to metres for the calculation. Measuring in metres gives 6.6 + <InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="MU120_A_SI071e.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation> = 19.2 metres. Your friend might need a safety margin so he should buy 20 metres at a cost of 20 × £4.50 = £90.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>Having completed a calculation it is important to check whether your answer makes sense. British money for example can only be issued to the nearest penny. If you share a bill for £20 among three people, your calculator would give an answer of £6.666 666 667. So how much should be paid by each person?</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>You would probably round up to £6.67 or £6.70 and put the extra pence in a charity tin.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>It is important, when performing a calculation, to consider the context of the problem you are solving. The final answers should take the context of the problem into account. This means using appropriate rounding in order to give sensible answers.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Suppose you were intending to buy sand to make a foundation for a path of slabs and the sand came in pre-packaged bags of 20 kg. If your calculations showed that, theoretically, you need 69 kg of sand, you would still have to buy four bags of sand, since three bags would be insufficient.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>You might be able to break a biscuit into halves, but it is difficult to give six children 4.833 3333 biscuits each. Similarly, an answer which suggests you can afford to take 10.134 people on an outing is not very sensible.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>When you get a mathematical answer, you need to interpret the answer within the context of the original problem and round your answer appropriately for the situation. So if you could afford to take 10.134 people on the trip, you would probably interpret this as ten people. As for 4.833 3333 biscuits, you would need to round down rather than up otherwise there would not be enough biscuits: four or four and a half might be all right, depending upon whether you could break them in half easily.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph><InlineEquation><Image src="equation_question.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation></Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Cost at £3 per metre (length) is £10.956, i.e. approximately £11.</Paragraph>
	</Question>
	<Answer>
		<Paragraph>Your friend would have been better converting all the lengths to metres first, as there is an error in the total. You might have spotted this since 7.04 m plus two other lengths must give more than 3.652 m. There is also another error:  1 m 76 mm is 1.076 m; and 4 times this is 4.304 m.</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>An estimate of the total lengths would have suggested something was wrong. Nine curtains at between half a metre and a metre in length will need between 4<InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="half.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation><!--insert half gif--> and 9 metres. At £3 per metre this is well over £11.</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>Your friend also needs to round up the lengths of material to allow for hemming.</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>So the corrected calculation would be like the on below:</Paragraph>
		<!--Insert calculation see sticker on book in folder-->
		<Paragraph><InlineEquation><Image src="equation_answer.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation></Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>Round up the length to 7.5 or 8 m to allow for hems, etc.</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>Cost at £3 per metre:</Paragraph>
		<Paragraph>  7.5 m costs £22.20;    8 m costs £24.00.</Paragraph>

<Question>
<Paragraph><b>5</b> Suppose you are in charge of dealing the cards in a game for large numbers of people. You have a pack of 200 cards and 35 players. The instructions say: ‘Deal as many cards as possible so that the players have the same number of cards each.’ Somebody says you should give each player five cards. Is this correct?</Paragraph>
</Question>
<Answer>
<Paragraph>200 ÷ 35 = 5.714 285 14.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Round down to the nearest whole card, so that there are sufficient cards to go round. So deal 5 cards each.</Paragraph>

<Question>
<Paragraph><b>6</b> Use your estimating skills and common sense to check the following calculation, line by line, for the cost of papering an irregularly shaped room with simple non-patterned wallpaper.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Height of walls = 275 cm</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Width of walls = 512 + 346 + 234 + 748 × 2 = 2588 cm</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Width of wallpaper = 50 cm</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Number of pieces of wallpaper needed = 2588 ÷ 50 = 51.76</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Total length of wallpaper needed = 51.76 × 275 = 14 234 cm</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Length of one roll = 10 m</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Cost of one roll = £4.00</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Number of rolls = 14 234 ÷ 10</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   Total cost = £4.00 × <InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="MU120_A_I177e.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation> = £5693.60</Paragraph></Question>
<Answer>

<Paragraph>The calculator calculations themselves are correct, but the total cost of over £5000 should suggest that something has gone wrong. The problem is that the length of a wallpaper roll is in metres (m) but the height of the room is in centimetres (cm). Hence the answer is out by a factor of 100. The correct answer for the total cost is therefore £5693.6 ÷ 100 = £56.94 (to the nearest penny).</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Also, the number of pieces probably needs to be a whole number, as does the number of rolls. So these answers need to be rounded up:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   number of pieces = 52</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>   number of rolls =  <InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="MU120_A_I178e.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation>  = 14.3, rounded up to 15 rolls.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Therefore the total cost is £4.00 × 15 = £60 (rather than nearly £5000).</Paragraph>

	<Question>
		<Paragraph><b>2</b> Suppose you went shopping with £30 cash and discount coupons to the value of £3.60 for various items that you intended to buy (such as £1 off a giant tin of biscuits). You did a rough estimate of your shopping bill by adding up the items you were buying (without taking the coupons into account) and it came to £25. Roughly how much cash would you expect to have left after paying the bill?</Paragraph>
	</Question>
	<Answer>
		<Paragraph>The amount of cash in pounds you will have left is roughly 30 + 3.60 − 25, or equivalently 30 − 25 + 3.60, i.e. about £8.60, or £9 (more roughly).</Paragraph>

	<Question>
		<Paragraph><b>3</b> Suppose you are one of four people buying some joint presents for a family of five. The presents cost £2.15, £3.02, £2.99 and two at £2.50. Estimate your share of this cost.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>However, when you used your calculator to calculate your share:</Paragraph>
<Paragraph/>
<Equation id="UEQN022"><Image src="MU120_A_U022e.gif" width="col_100"/><Description/></Equation>
<Paragraph>using the calculator you got the answer £9.41. Why doesn’t this answer make sense? Investigate what you might have done wrong.</Paragraph>
	</Question>
	<Answer>
		<Paragraph>The cost of the presents is roughly £2 + £3 + £3 + £5 (= 2 × £2.50), which is £13. So your share is roughly <!--<InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="MU120_A_I174e.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation>-->13/4 = £3.25. Another way of estimating is to notice that all the five presents cost two or three pounds, so the total cost will not exceed about 5 × £3 = £15. Therefore each of the four people's share of the cost must be less than £4 (since 4 × £4 = £16). In any event, £9.41 is clearly wrong.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>What you have done is to calculate 2.15 + 3.02 + 2.99 + 2 × 2.50 ÷ 4, which your calculator interprets as 2.15 + 3.02 + 2.99 + (2 × 2.50 ÷ 4). You need to work out 2.15 + 3.02 + 2.99 + 2 × 2.50 first and then divide this total by 4. This can be achieved using brackets: (2.15 + 3.02 + 2.99 + 2 × 2.50) ÷ 4. (The exact answer is £3.29.)</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph><b>4</b> Suppose you were sharing 28 biscuits among 5 children and you did the calculation 28 ÷ 5 = 5.6. How many biscuits would you give each child?</Paragraph>
	</Question>
	<Answer>
		<Paragraph>If you rounded 5.6 up to 6 and gave the answer as 6, you would not have enough biscuits, since 6 × 5 = 30 and you only have 28 biscuits.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>If you rounded down and gave 5 biscuits each, you would have three over, since 5 × 5 = 25. (You might eat these yourself or keep them to give as rewards later.)</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>You might be able to break a biscuit into two and so answer <InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="MU120_A_I175e.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation>, which gives <InlineEquation shiftby="-4"><Image src="MU120_A_I176e.gif"/><Description/></InlineEquation>, leaving half a biscuit for you.</Paragraph>

		<Paragraph><b>5</b> Suppose you were considering purchasing a patterned carpet, priced at £15.75 per square metre, for the room shown in the diagram below which a friend has measured for you. It might be appropriate to use rounded values.</Paragraph>

<ListItem><Paragraph><b>(c)</b> Would your estimate alter if the required carpet is from a roll 4 metres wide?</Paragraph></ListItem>
</UnNumberedList>
	</Question>
	<Answer>
<UnNumberedList>
<ListItem><Paragraph><b>(a) </b>The measurement should be rounded up for practical purposes, since otherwise the carpet may be too small for the room. An accuracy to the nearest 0.1 metre would be sufficient. Then the length of the room would be rounded to 3.6 metres and the width to 2.8 metres. (If the room is not exactly rectangular you might add on more for safety.)</Paragraph></ListItem>
<ListItem><Paragraph><b>(b)</b> To estimate the area and hence the price, you might round even more to 3.5 × 3. These values give an area of 10.5 square metres. So round to 10. Round the price to £16 per square metre. So the estimate is £160.</Paragraph></ListItem>
<ListItem><Paragraph><b>(c)</b> If the carpet has a roll-width of 4 metres you have two options, depending upon whether the direction of the pattern on the carpet is important to you. This means you may need (approximately) either a 3 metre length (12 sq metres) or a length of 3.5 metres (14.5 sq metres). So you will need another 2 or 4 sq metres. This adds on about £30 or £60 giving an estimate of £190 or £220 respectively.</Paragraph></ListItem>

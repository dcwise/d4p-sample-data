          <p>When using a calculator many people have ‘blind faith’ in its capacity to
            provide the correct result.</p>
          <p>Calculators invariably provide the correct result for the information they are
            given; any errors are due to the operator.</p>
          <p>To help guard against errors, always give a ‘ball-park’ estimate for a problem,
            using rounded values and easy calculations.</p>
          <p>For example, make a rough estimate of the calculation below to act as a check
            upon the actual calculation using the calculator.</p>
          <p>3.421 + 5.986 + 12.009 87 = ?</p>
          
          <p>Rough check: 3 + 6 + 12 = 21</p>
          <p>Calculator answer: 21.416 87</p>
          <p>The two answers are within the same ‘ball-park’ so you should be happy with the
            calculator's answer. Had you got an answer of 3438.995 87, say, you should be suspicious
            and checking would reveal you had missed out a decimal point.</p>
          <p>It is helpful to adopt this checking strategy for all your calculations since
            it is so easy to press the wrong key inadvertently, or double press a key when working
            at speed on a calculator.</p>
          <p>Often it is useful to have both an underestimate and an
            overestimate.</p>

            <p>Look back at <xref href="#EXA009">Example 9</xref>, which gave an incorrect answer. How could you
              have spotted this without doing the whole calculation?</p>

              <p>First do an overestimate, then an underestimate, per person.</p>
              <p>In an overestimate, ignore the float and round the food up to £40, drinks
                to £6, taxi £4, tip £3 minus £5 discount gives £48 this is less than £50. Divide by
                5 people means the maximum share for each person is £10. Hence £10.80 is too
                much.</p>
              <p>An underestimate would be £35 for food, £5 for drinks, £3 for taxi and £3
                for tip, less £5 for the voucher and £1 float. This gives £40, divided by 5, which
                means minimum of £8 each.</p>
              <p>Hence you would expect an answer between £8 and £10.</p>

         </sectiondiv>
          <p>One common error when using a calculator is to forget that the calculator does
            not total everything as it goes along. So, for example, in the case of the bill for a
            night out, you must total everything before you divide by the number of people who are
            sharing the bill.</p>

               <b>Example 12</b>
            </p>
            <p>Look back at <xref href="#EXA008">Example 8</xref> and suppose that the calculation was put into a
              scientific calculator, in the following form:</p>
            <p>0.04 + 5.00 + 8.00 − 36.98 − 5.10 − 3.50 − 3.00 ÷ 4 = ?</p>
            
            <p>Would this give the right answer?</p>

               <p outputclass="SubHeading">
                  <b>Solution</b>
               </p>
              <p>No, it would not give the right answer. The calculator will do the division
                first, i.e. 3.00 ÷ 4, and then all the additions and subtractions, to give the
                answer <sup>−</sup>32.93. And £32.93 is clearly too much for each person's share of
                the bill.</p>
              <p>In order to make it do the calculation correctly, you can either total
                after the 3.00, by using the ‘=’ (or ‘ENTER’) button, or use brackets.</p>
              <p>(0.40 + 5.00 + 8.00 − 36.98 − 5.10 − 3.50 − 3.00) ÷ 4</p>

                  <b>3</b> Suppose a friend has worked out the price of carpeting some stairs
                with carpet which costs £4.50 per square metre.</p>
              <fig>
                  <image href="../../media/MU120_A_I054i.jpg"/>
                  <p>Text</p>
               </fig>
              <p>The stairs are in three flights of ten, and each step requires 25 cm for
                the tread and 17 cm for the rise. The stair width is nearly one metre. There are
                also landings to be carpeted of length 1.2 m and 5.4 m, both one metre wide. By
                estimating what the answer should be, and then working through what he has done,
                check the calculation below for your friend.</p>
              <p>Each stair 25 + 17 = 42</p>
              <p>Ten stairs 42 × 10 = 420</p>
              <p>Three flights of stairs 420 × 3 = 1260</p>
              <p>Landings 1.2 + 5.4 = 6.6</p>
              <p>Total length 6.6 + 1260 = 1266.6</p>
              <p>Cost £4.50 × 1266.6 = £5699.7</p>
            </sectiondiv>
            <sectiondiv outputclass="Answer">
              <p>£5699.7 seems a lot for a stair carpet.</p>
              <p>Estimate of answer: Length needed for one step <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">

                  </ph> 0.2 + 0.2 <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">

                  </ph>0.4m.</p>
              <p>Length needed for 10 stairs <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">
                     <image href="../../media/asymptotically.gif"/>
                     <ph outputclass="inlineequation-description"/>
                  </ph> 10 × 0.4 = 4
                m</p>
              <p>So length needed for 30 stairs <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">

                     <ph outputclass="inlineequation-description"/>
                  </ph> 4 × 3 = 12
                m.</p>
              <p>Landings need <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">
                     <image href="../../media/asymptotically.gif"/>
                     <ph outputclass="inlineequation-description"/>
                  </ph>1 + 6 <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">
                     <image href="../../media/asymptotically.gif"/>
                     <ph outputclass="inlineequation-description"/>
                  </ph> 7m</p>
              <p>So total length needed = 12 + 7 = 19 <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">
                     <image href="../../media/asymptotically.gif"/>
                     <ph outputclass="inlineequation-description"/>
                  </ph> 20 m.</p>
              <p>So cost would be about 20 × 5 = £100 which is a lot less than
                £5699.70.</p>
              <p>The stairs are measured in cms and the landings are measured in metres. So
                in calculating ‘total length’ your friend has added numbers of different units. The
                cost of the carpet is in pounds per metre, so it is sensible to convert centimetres
                to metres for the calculation. Measuring in metres gives 6.6 + <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">
                     <image href="../../media/MU120_A_SI071e.gif"/>
                     <ph outputclass="inlineequation-description"/>
                  </ph> = 19.2 metres. Your
                friend might need a safety margin so he should buy 20 metres at a cost of 20 × £4.50
                = £90.</p>

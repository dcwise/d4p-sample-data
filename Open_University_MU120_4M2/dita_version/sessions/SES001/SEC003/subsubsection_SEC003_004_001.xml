                <p>You may have worked out a ball-park figure rather than under and over
                  estimates or you may have used different estimates. This does not matter as long
                  as you can check on whether your calculator answer is what you would

                  <b>2</b> You are helping a friend, Al, who is preparing a base for a new
                  garage. He needs to purchase ready-made concrete from a local supplier. The
                  concrete is sold in units of cubic metres so he needs to calculate how much to
                  order.</p>
                <fig>
                  <image href="../../media/MU120_A_I053i.jpg"/>
                  <p/>
               </fig>
                <p>The plan of the proposed garage is shown in the diagram above. Following
                  advice from a builder the base is to have a thickness of 200 mm. Al's estimate for
                  concrete required is given below.</p>
                <p>volume = length × width × thickness</p>
                <p>volume = 6.56 × 4.68 × 2.00</p>
                <p>volume = 61.4016 cubic metres</p>
                <p>Hence volume of concrete needed is 61 cubic metres, to 2 s.f.</p>
                <p>Make a rough estimate of what you would expect the answer to be. Are you
                  happy with Al's calculation?</p>

                  </ph> 7 cubic
                  metres.</p>
                <p>Al's estimate = 61 cubic metres which seems rather large, by a factor of
                  about ten, so you should not be happy with his estimate.</p>
                <p>He has said that 200 mm = 2 m whereas he should have used 0.2 m: he
                  should have divided 200 by 1000 rather than 100. (There are 1000 mm in 1
                  m.)</p>

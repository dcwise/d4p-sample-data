   <title>3.3 Have I given due consideration to units of measurement?</title>
   <learningContentbody>
      <section>
          
          <p>Many mathematical problems include units of
            measurement. The measurement may be of length,
            weight, time, temperature or currency. The UK uses both metric and imperial
            units.</p>
          <p>The table below gives the units of length that are in everyday use in the UK,
            but you may know some others.</p>

          <p>There is a great variety of measurement units in use. Their incorrect use leads
            to errors which can sometimes be costly.</p>
          <p>On 23 September 1999, NASA lost a $125 million Mars orbiter. This was because
            an engineering team used imperial units of measurement while NASA's team used the metric
            system for a key spacecraft operation.</p>

            <p>Suppose that you want to buy a carpet, priced at £16.00 per square metre, for
              the room shown above and you calculate the area as follows.</p>
            <p>Area = 5 × 450 = 2250</p>
            <p>Cost of carpet = 16 × 2250 = £3600</p>
            <p>An expensive carpet! What is wrong?</p>

                  <b>Solution</b>
               </p>
              <p>There is a mixture of units: metres and centimetres.</p>
              <p>If a problem has a mixture of measurement units, it is usually a good idea
                to convert all measures to the same units. Here the carpet is sold in units of
                ‘square metres’, therefore ensure all the measurements are in metres.</p>
              <p>Hence area required = 5 × 4.50.</p>
              <p>Area = 22.5 square metres.</p>
              <p>Cost of carpet = £16 × 22.5 = £360.</p>

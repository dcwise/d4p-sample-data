              <sectiondiv outputclass="Answer">
                <p>Your friend would have been better converting all the lengths to metres
                  first, as there is an error in the total. You might have spotted this since 7.04 m
                  plus two other lengths must give more than 3.652 m. There is also another error: 1
                  m 76 mm is 1.076 m; and 4 times this is 4.304 m.</p>
                <p>An estimate of the total lengths would have suggested something was
                  wrong. Nine curtains at between half a metre and a metre in length will need

                  metres. At £3 per metre this is well over £11.</p>
                <p>Your friend also needs to round up the lengths of material to allow for
                  hemming.</p>
                <p>So the corrected calculation would be like the on below:</p>

               </p>
                <p>Round up the length to 7.5 or 8 m to allow for hems, etc.</p>
                <p>Cost at £3 per metre:</p>
                <p>  7.5 m costs £22.20;    8 m costs £24.00.</p>
                <p>(You might also have queried his measurements, since some of the windows
                  seem very small. Might he have confused centimetres with inches? For example
                  should the first length really be 67 in?)</p>

              <sectiondiv outputclass="Answer">
                <p>The calculator calculations themselves are correct, but the total cost of
                  over £5000 should suggest that something has gone wrong. The problem is that the
                  length of a wallpaper roll is in metres (m) but the height of the room is in
                  centimetres (cm). Hence the answer is out by a factor of 100. The correct answer
                  for the total cost is therefore £5693.6 ÷ 100 = £56.94 (to the nearest
                  penny).</p>
                <p>Also, the number of pieces probably needs to be a whole number, as does
                  the number of rolls. So these answers need to be rounded up:</p>
                <p>   number of pieces = 52</p>
                <p>   number of rolls =  <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">

                  </ph>  = 14.3, rounded up
                  to 15 rolls.</p>
                <p>Therefore the total cost is £4.00 × 15 = £60 (rather than nearly
                  £5000).</p>

                  <b>1</b> In a supermarket the bill comes to £8.70, and you have discount
                  coupons worth £3.50. The assistant says ‘that will be £12.20 please’. Is she
                  right?</p>
              </sectiondiv>
              <sectiondiv outputclass="Answer">
                <p>No. You owe £8.70, but the coupons have paid £3.50, so you owe £8.70 −
                  £3.50 = £5.20. The assistant wrongly added instead of subtracting.</p>

                  <b>2</b> Suppose a young friend, Tom, has run some errands for you, for
                  which you have given him £20 plus some discount coupons for the supermarket. He
                  presents you with your shopping, the following calculation and £1
                  change.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>received from you £20.00</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>stamps from post office £5.00, leaves £15.00</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>supermarket bill £12.50, leaves £2.50</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>discount coupons £1.50, leaves £1.00</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Has Tom done the right calculation?</p>
            </sectiondiv>
              <sectiondiv outputclass="Answer">
                <p>No. Tom should have added not subtracted the value of the discount
                  coupons, since they are the equivalent of money received, not spent. Alternatively
                  he could have subtracted them from the supermarket bill before subtracting this:
                  15 − (12.50 − 1.50) is the same as 15 − 12.50 + 1.50.</p>

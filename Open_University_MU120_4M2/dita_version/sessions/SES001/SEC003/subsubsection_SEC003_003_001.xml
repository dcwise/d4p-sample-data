                  <b>1</b> A friend has been quoted a price of £25.50 per square yard for
                  tarmac surfacing of his yard. The yard measures 6 yards by 10 feet. Here is his
                  calculation of the total cost. What is wrong with it?</p>
                
                <p>cost = £25.50 × 6 × 10 = £1530</p>

                <p>He has not used the same units. The figure 10 he used refers to feet, so
                  in a calculation using yards he needs
                  10/3
                  (3 feet = 1 yard). The cost should be</p>

                  <b>2</b> Another friend, Kim, wishes to reproof her tent. A litre tin of
                  ‘proofing agent’ states that the coverage is roughly 5 square metres per litre.
                  The manufacturer's measurements of the tent, which is a ridge tent, are: height 2
                  m, length 3 m. However, Kim realises that she needs the other measurements. Here
                  is her diagram and calculation.</p>

                  <p/>
               </fig>
                <p>The problem: how many litres of proofing agent to buy to cover the
                  tent?</p>
                <p>    Area of 2 side panels 2 × 3 × 250 = 1500</p>
                <p>    Area of end door panels together 2 × 150 + 150 = 450</p>
                <p>    Total area = 1950</p>
                <p>    Number of litres = 1950 ÷ 5 = 390</p>
                <p>Kim thinks this is rather a lot and asks you to help. Find her
                  errors.</p>
              </sectiondiv>
              <sectiondiv outputclass="Answer">
                <p>The errors are</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>Not converting the centimetres to metres.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The order of operations for calculating the end door
                      panels.</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Correct answer should be</p>
                <p>Areas are:</p>
                <p>
                  <i>sides</i> 2 × 3 × 2.5 = 15 metres squared</p>
                <p>
                  <i>doors</i> 2 × (1.5 + 1.5) = 6 metres squared</p>
                <p>Total area = 21 metres squared</p>
                <p>Number of litres = 21 ÷ 5 = 4.2 litres</p>
                <p>Therefore Kim needs to buy 5 litres of proofing agent.</p>

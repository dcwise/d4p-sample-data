                  <b>2</b> Suppose you went shopping with £30 cash and discount coupons to
                  the value of £3.60 for various items that you intended to buy (such as £1 off a
                  giant tin of biscuits). You did a rough estimate of your shopping bill by adding
                  up the items you were buying (without taking the coupons into account) and it came
                  to £25. Roughly how much cash would you expect to have left after paying the

                  <b>3</b> Suppose you are one of four people buying some joint presents
                  for a family of five. The presents cost £2.15, £3.02, £2.99 and two at £2.50.
                  Estimate your share of this cost.</p>
                <p>However, when you used your calculator to calculate your
                  share:</p>

                  <p outputclass="equation-description"/>
               </fig>
                <p>using the calculator you got the answer £9.41. Why doesn’t this answer
                  make sense? Investigate what you might have done wrong.</p>
              </sectiondiv>
              <sectiondiv outputclass="Answer">
                <p>The cost of the presents is roughly £2 + £3 + £3 + £5 (= 2 × £2.50),
                  which is £13. So your share is roughly
                  13/4
                  = £3.25. Another way of estimating is to notice that all the five presents cost
                  two or three pounds, so the total cost will not exceed about 5 × £3 = £15.
                  Therefore each of the four people's share of the cost must be less than £4 (since
                  4 × £4 = £16). In any event, £9.41 is clearly wrong.</p>
                <p>What you have done is to calculate 2.15 + 3.02 + 2.99 + 2 × 2.50 ÷ 4,
                  which your calculator interprets as 2.15 + 3.02 + 2.99 + (2 × 2.50 ÷ 4). You need
                  to work out 2.15 + 3.02 + 2.99 + 2 × 2.50 first and then divide this total by 4.
                  This can be achieved using brackets: (2.15 + 3.02 + 2.99 + 2 × 2.50) ÷ 4. (The
                  exact answer is £3.29.)</p>

                  <b>4</b> Suppose you were sharing 28 biscuits among 5 children and you
                  did the calculation 28 ÷ 5 = 5.6. How many biscuits would you give each
                  child?</p>

              <sectiondiv outputclass="Answer">
                <p>If you rounded 5.6 up to 6 and gave the answer as 6, you would not have

                <p>If you rounded down and gave 5 biscuits each, you would have three over,
                  since 5 × 5 = 25. (You might eat these yourself or keep them to give as rewards
                  later.)</p>

                        <b>(a) </b>The measurement should be rounded up for practical
                      purposes, since otherwise the carpet may be too small for the room. An
                      accuracy to the nearest 0.1 metre would be sufficient. Then the length of the
                      room would be rounded to 3.6 metres and the width to 2.8 metres. (If the room
                      is not exactly rectangular you might add on more for safety.)</p>

                    <p>
                        <b>(b)</b> To estimate the area and hence the price, you might round
                      even more to 3.5 × 3. These values give an area of 10.5 square metres. So
                      round to 10. Round the price to £16 per square metre. So the estimate is
                      £160.</p>

                    <p>
                        <b>(c)</b> If the carpet has a roll-width of 4 metres you have two
                      options, depending upon whether the direction of the pattern on the carpet is
                      important to you. This means you may need (approximately) either a 3 metre
                      length (12 sq metres) or a length of 3.5 metres (14.5 sq metres). So you will
                      need another 2 or 4 sq metres. This adds on about £30 or £60 giving an
                      estimate of £190 or £220 respectively.</p>

                      be in a bit of a mess here if you just bought 200 square metres. This example
                      illustrates that in many practical situations it is safer to overestimate than
                      underestimate.)</p>

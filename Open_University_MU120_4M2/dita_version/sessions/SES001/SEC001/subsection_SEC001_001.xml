          <p>The English mathematician Charles Babbage, father of modern computing, once
            wrote to Tennyson regarding one of his poems:</p>
          <p>‘In your otherwise beautiful poem,’ Babbage wrote, ‘one verse
            reads,</p>
          
            <p>Every moment dies a man,</p>
            <p>Every moment one is born.</p>
          
          <p>‘If this were true, the population of the world would be at a standstill. In
            truth, the rate of birth is slightly in excess of that of death. I would
            suggest:</p>
          
            <p>Every moment dies a man,</p>
            <p>Every moment 1 <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">

               <ph outputclass="inlineequation-description"/>
            </ph>
              is born</p>
          
          <p>‘Strictly speaking,’ Babbage added, ‘the actual figure is so long I cannot get
            it into a line, but I believe the figure 1 <ph outputclass="InlineEquation">
               <image href="../../media/MU120_4M2_001ie.gif"/>
               <ph outputclass="inlineequation-description"/>
            </ph>
            will be sufficiently accurate for poetry.’</p>
          <p>Newspapers, magazines and television often provide numerical information such
            as that below.</p>

          <p>How do you interpret the figures in the headlines above?</p>
          <p>It is unlikely that the monthly balance of payments deficit, for example, would
            be exactly £25 000 000. (Remember 25,000,000 means the same as 25 000 000.) It's more
            likely to be a number fairly close to £25 000 00: a number like £24 695 481 or
            £25 332 206. From the reader's point of view, £25 000 000 gives an idea of the size of
            the deficit; it's a <i>good approximation</i>. Large numbers in particular are often
            approximated in this way. This process is called <b>rounding</b>.</p>
          <p>When you use your calculator, you will need to interpret the results. Part of
            this interpretation is rounding the answer appropriately.</p>

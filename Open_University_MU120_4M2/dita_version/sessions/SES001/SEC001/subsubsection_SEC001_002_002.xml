   <title>Rounding to the nearest ten</title>
   <learningContentbody>
      <section>
            
            <p>The blouse in the figure above was £19 and you may well have thought of it as
              roughly £20. In this case you would be <i>rounding to the nearest ten</i>
              (pounds).</p>
            <p>The rule for rounding to the nearest hundred can be adapted easily to
              rounding to the nearest ten. Instead of looking at the tens digit look at the units
              digit.</p>
            <p>So £23 is rounded down (to £20) and £36 is rounded up (to £40).</p>

            </p>
              <p>The distance from London to Newcastle is 282 miles. Round this distance to
                the nearest 10 miles and the nearest hundred miles.</p>

                  <b>Solution</b>
               </p>
                <p>To round to the nearest 10, look at the units digit. This is a 2, so
                  round down to 280 miles.</p>
                <p>To round to the nearest 100, look at the tens digit. This is 8, so round
                  up to 300 miles.</p>
                <p>Therefore the distance from London to Newcastle is 280 miles, to the
                  nearest ten miles, and 300 miles, to the nearest hundred miles.</p>

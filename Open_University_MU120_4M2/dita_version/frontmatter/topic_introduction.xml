      <p>For many calculations you use a calculator. The main aim of this unit is to help
        you to do this in a sensible and fruitful way. Using a calculation to solve a problem
        involves four main stages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Stage 1: working out what calculation you want to do;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stage 2: working out roughly what size of answer to expect from your
            calculation;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stage 3: carrying out the calculation;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stage 4: interpreting the answer â€“ Does it agree with the rough estimate? Does
            it make sense in terms of the original problem?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This unit focuses on Stages 2 and
        4.</p>

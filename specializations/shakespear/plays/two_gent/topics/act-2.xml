            <line>Sir, your glove.</line>

            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Not mine; my gloves are on.</line>

            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:</line>
            <line>Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!</line>
            <line>Ah, Silvia, Silvia!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>How now, sirrah?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>She is not within hearing, sir.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Why, sir, who bade you call her?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Well, you'll still be too forward.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>She that your worship loves?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Why, how know you that I am in love?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Marry, by these special marks: first, you have</line>
            <line>learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,</line>
            <line>like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a</line>
            <line>robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had</line>
            <line>the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had</line>
            <line>lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had</line>
            <line>buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes</line>
            <line>diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to</line>
            <line>speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were</line>
            <line>wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you</line>
            <line>walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you</line>
            <line>fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you</line>
            <line>looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you</line>
            <line>are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look</line>
            <line>on you, I can hardly think you my master.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Are all these things perceived in me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>They are all perceived without ye.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Without me? they cannot.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you</line>
            <line>were so simple, none else would: but you are so</line>
            <line>without these follies, that these follies are within</line>
            <line>you and shine through you like the water in an</line>
            <line>urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a</line>
            <line>physician to comment on your malady.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Why, sir, I know her not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet</line>
            <line>knowest her not?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Is she not hard-favoured, sir?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Sir, I know that well enough.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>What dost thou know?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>That's because the one is painted and the other out</line>
            <line>of all count.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>How painted? and how out of count?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no</line>
            <line>man counts of her beauty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>You never saw her since she was deformed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>How long hath she been deformed?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Ever since you loved her.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>

            <line>Why?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;</line>
            <line>or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to</line>
            <line>have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going</line>
            <line>ungartered!</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>What should I see then?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SPEED</speaker>
            <line>Your own present folly and her passing deformity:</line>
            <line>for he, being in love, could not see to garter his</line>
            <line>hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last</line>

            <line>True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,</line>
            <line>you swinged me for my love, which makes me the</line>
            <line>bolder to chide you for yours.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>In conclusion, I stand affected to her.</line>

            <line>Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:</line>
            <line>I have done penance for contemning Love,</line>
            <line>Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me</line>
            <line>With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,</line>
            <line>With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;</line>
            <line>For in revenge of my contempt of love,</line>
            <line>Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes</line>
            <line>And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.</line>
            <line>O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,</line>
            <line>And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,</line>
            <line>There is no woe to his correction,</line>
            <line>Nor to his service no such joy on earth.</line>
            <line>Now no discourse, except it be of love;</line>
            <line>Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,</line>
            <line>Upon the very naked name of love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.</line>

            <line>Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,</line>

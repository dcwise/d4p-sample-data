         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>For that which now torments me to rehearse:</line>
            <line>I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;</line>
            <line>But yet I slew him manfully in fight,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Outlaw</speaker>
            <line>Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.</line>

            <line>Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,</line>
            <line>Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth</line>
            <line>Thrust from the company of awful men:</line>
            <line>Myself was from Verona banished</line>
            <line>For practising to steal away a lady,</line>
            <line>An heir, and near allied unto the duke.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Outlaw</speaker>
            <line>And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,</line>
            <line>Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Outlaw</speaker>
            <line>And I for such like petty crimes as these,</line>
            <line>But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,</line>
            <line>That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;</line>
            <line>And partly, seeing you are beautified</line>
            <line>With goodly shape and by your own report</line>
            <line>A linguist and a man of such perfection</line>
            <line>As we do in our quality much want--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Outlaw</speaker>
            <line>Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,</line>
            <line>Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:</line>
            <line>Are you content to be our general?</line>
            <line>To make a virtue of necessity</line>
            <line>And live, as we do, in this wilderness?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Outlaw</speaker>
            <line>What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?</line>
            <line>Say ay, and be the captain of us all:</line>
            <line>We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,</line>
            <line>Love thee as our commander and our king.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Outlaw</speaker>

            <speaker>Second Outlaw</speaker>
            <line>Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>I take your offer and will live with you,</line>
            <line>Provided that you do no outrages</line>
            <line>On silly women or poor passengers.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Outlaw</speaker>
            <line>No, we detest such vile base practises.</line>
            <line>Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,</line>
            <line>And show thee all the treasure we have got,</line>
            <line>Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.</line>

            <line>Already have I been false to Valentine</line>

            <line>Under the colour of commending him,</line>
            <line>I have access my own love to prefer:</line>
            <line>But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,</line>
            <line>To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.</line>
            <line>When I protest true loyalty to her,</line>
            <line>She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;</line>
            <line>When to her beauty I commend my vows,</line>
            <line>She bids me think how I have been forsworn</line>
            <line>In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:</line>
            <line>And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,</line>
            <line>The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,</line>
            <line>Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,</line>
            <line>The more it grows and fawneth on her still.</line>
            <line>But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,</line>

            <line>When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,</line>
            <line>look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a</line>
            <line>puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or</line>
            <line>four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.</line>
            <line>I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,</line>
            <line>'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver</line>
            <line>him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;</line>
            <line>and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he</line>
            <line>steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:</line>
            <line>O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself</line>
            <line>in all companies! I would have, as one should say,</line>
            <line>one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,</line>
            <line>as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had</line>
            <line>more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,</line>
            <line>I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I</line>
            <line>live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He</line>
            <line>thrusts me himself into the company of three or four</line>
            <line>gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had</line>
            <line>not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but</line>
            <line>all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says</line>
            <line>one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him</line>
            <line>out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.</line>
            <line>I, having been acquainted with the smell before,</line>
            <line>knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that</line>
            <line>whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip</line>
            <line>the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him</line>
            <line>the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you</line>
            <line>wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out</line>
            <line>of the chamber. How many masters would do this for</line>
            <line>his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the</line>
            <line>stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had</line>
            <line>been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese</line>
            <line>he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.</line>

            <line>Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I</line>

            <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
            <line>Because methinks that she loved you as well</line>
            <line>As you do love your lady Silvia:</line>

            <line>Well, give her that ring and therewithal</line>
            <line>This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady</line>
            <line>I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.</line>
            <line>Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,</line>

            <line>Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd</line>
            <line>A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.</line>
            <line>Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him</line>
            <line>That with his very heart despiseth me?</line>
            <line>Because he loves her, he despiseth me;</line>
            <line>Because I love him I must pity him.</line>
            <line>This ring I gave him when he parted from me,</line>
            <line>To bind him to remember my good will;</line>
            <line>And now am I, unhappy messenger,</line>
            <line>To plead for that which I would not obtain,</line>
            <line>To carry that which I would have refused,</line>
            <line>To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.</line>
            <line>I am my master's true-confirmed love;</line>
            <line>But cannot be true servant to my master,</line>
            <line>Unless I prove false traitor to myself.</line>
            <line>Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly</line>

            <line>Go give your master this: tell him from me,</line>
            <line>One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,</line>

            <line>Madam, please you peruse this letter.--</line>
            <line>Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised</line>
            <line>Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:</line>
            <line>This is the letter to your ladyship.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SILVIA</speaker>

            <speaker>SILVIA</speaker>
            <line>There, hold!</line>
            <line>I will not look upon your master's lines:</line>
            <line>I know they are stuff'd with protestations</line>
            <line>And full of new-found oaths; which he will break</line>
            <line>As easily as I do tear his paper.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
            <line>Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SILVIA</speaker>
            <line>The more shame for him that he sends it me;</line>
            <line>For I have heard him say a thousand times</line>
            <line>His Julia gave it him at his departure.</line>
            <line>Though his false finger have profaned the ring,</line>
            <line>Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</line>

            <line>I thank you, madam, that you tender her.</line>

            <line>Almost as well as I do know myself:</line>
            <line>To think upon her woes I do protest</line>
            <line>That I have wept a hundred several times.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SILVIA</speaker>
            <line>Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
            <line>I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.</line>

            <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
            <line>She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:</line>
            <line>When she did think my master loved her well,</line>
            <line>She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:</line>
            <line>But since she did neglect her looking-glass</line>
            <line>And threw her sun-expelling mask away,</line>
            <line>The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks</line>
            <line>And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,</line>
            <line>That now she is become as black as I.</line>

            <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
            <line>About my stature; for at Pentecost,</line>
            <line>When all our pageants of delight were play'd,</line>
            <line>Our youth got me to play the woman's part,</line>
            <line>And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,</line>
            <line>Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,</line>
            <line>As if the garment had been made for me:</line>
            <line>Therefore I know she is about my height.</line>
            <line>And at that time I made her weep agood,</line>
            <line>For I did play a lamentable part:</line>
            <line>Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning</line>
            <line>For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;</line>
            <line>Which I so lively acted with my tears</line>
            <line>That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,</line>
            <line>Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead</line>
            <line>If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SILVIA</speaker>
            <line>She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.</line>
            <line>Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!</line>
            <line>I weep myself to think upon thy words.</line>
            <line>Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this</line>
            <line>For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.</line>
            <line>Farewell.</line>

            <line>And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.</line>
            <line>A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful</line>
            <line>I hope my master's suit will be but cold,</line>
            <line>Since she respects my mistress' love so much.</line>
            <line>Alas, how love can trifle with itself!</line>
            <line>Here is her picture: let me see; I think,</line>
            <line>If I had such a tire, this face of mine</line>
            <line>Were full as lovely as is this of hers:</line>
            <line>And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,</line>
            <line>Unless I flatter with myself too much.</line>
            <line>Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:</line>
            <line>If that be all the difference in his love,</line>
            <line>I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.</line>
            <line>Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:</line>
            <line>Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.</line>
            <line>What should it be that he respects in her</line>
            <line>But I can make respective in myself,</line>
            <line>If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</line>
            <line>Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,</line>
            <line>For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,</line>
            <line>Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!</line>
            <line>And, were there sense in his idolatry,</line>
            <line>My substance should be statue in thy stead.</line>
            <line>I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,</line>
            <line>That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,</line>
            <line>I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes</line>
            <line>To make my master out of love with thee!</line>

         <stagedir>Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;</line>
            <line>We have some secrets to confer about.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit THURIO</stagedir>
            <line>Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>My gracious lord, that which I would discover</line>
            <line>The law of friendship bids me to conceal;</line>
            <line>But when I call to mind your gracious favours</line>
            <line>Done to me, undeserving as I am,</line>
            <line>My duty pricks me on to utter that</line>
            <line>Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</line>
            <line>Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</line>
            <line>This night intends to steal away your daughter:</line>
            <line>Myself am one made privy to the plot.</line>
            <line>I know you have determined to bestow her</line>
            <line>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;</line>
            <line>And should she thus be stol'n away from you,</line>
            <line>It would be much vexation to your age.</line>
            <line>Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose</line>
            <line>To cross my friend in his intended drift</line>
            <line>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</line>
            <line>A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</line>
            <line>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;</line>
            <line>Which to requite, command me while I live.</line>
            <line>This love of theirs myself have often seen,</line>
            <line>Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,</line>
            <line>And oftentimes have purposed to forbid</line>
            <line>Sir Valentine her company and my court:</line>
            <line>But fearing lest my jealous aim might err</line>
            <line>And so unworthily disgrace the man,</line>
            <line>A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,</line>
            <line>I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</line>
            <line>That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.</line>
            <line>And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</line>
            <line>Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</line>
            <line>I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,</line>
            <line>The key whereof myself have ever kept;</line>
            <line>And thence she cannot be convey'd away.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean</line>
            <line>How he her chamber-window will ascend</line>
            <line>And with a corded ladder fetch her down;</line>
            <line>For which the youthful lover now is gone</line>
            <line>And this way comes he with it presently;</line>
            <line>Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.</line>
            <line>But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly</line>
            <line>That my discovery be not aimed at;</line>
            <line>For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</line>
            <line>Hath made me publisher of this pretence.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Upon mine honour, he shall never know</line>
            <line>That I had any light from thee of this.</line>

            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Please it your grace, there is a messenger</line>
            <line>That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</line>
            <line>And I am going to deliver them.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Be they of much import?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>The tenor of them doth but signify</line>
            <line>My health and happy being at your court.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;</line>
            <line>I am to break with thee of some affairs</line>
            <line>That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.</line>
            <line>'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</line>
            <line>To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match</line>
            <line>Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman</line>
            <line>Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities</line>
            <line>Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:</line>
            <line>Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,</line>
            <line>Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</line>
            <line>Neither regarding that she is my child</line>
            <line>Nor fearing me as if I were her father;</line>
            <line>And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,</line>
            <line>Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;</line>
            <line>And, where I thought the remnant of mine age</line>
            <line>Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,</line>
            <line>I now am full resolved to take a wife</line>
            <line>And turn her out to who will take her in:</line>
            <line>Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;</line>
            <line>For me and my possessions she esteems not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>What would your Grace have me to do in this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>There is a lady in Verona here</line>
            <line>Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy</line>
            <line>And nought esteems my aged eloquence:</line>
            <line>Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--</line>
            <line>For long agone I have forgot to court;</line>
            <line>Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--</line>
            <line>How and which way I may bestow myself</line>
            <line>To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</line>
            <line>Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</line>
            <line>More than quick words do move a woman's mind.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.</line>
            <line>Send her another; never give her o'er;</line>
            <line>For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</line>
            <line>If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,</line>
            <line>But rather to beget more love in you:</line>
            <line>If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;</line>
            <line>For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</line>
            <line>Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;</line>
            <line>For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'</line>
            <line>Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</line>
            <line>Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.</line>
            <line>That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,</line>
            <line>If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>But she I mean is promised by her friends</line>
            <line>Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</line>
            <line>And kept severely from resort of men,</line>
            <line>That no man hath access by day to her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Why, then, I would resort to her by night.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,</line>
            <line>That no man hath recourse to her by night.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>What lets but one may enter at her window?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</line>
            <line>And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</line>
            <line>Without apparent hazard of his life.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,</line>
            <line>To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</line>
            <line>Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,</line>
            <line>So bold Leander would adventure it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,</line>
            <line>Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>This very night; for Love is like a child,</line>
            <line>That longs for every thing that he can come by.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:</line>
            <line>How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</line>
            <line>Under a cloak that is of any length.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</line>

            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Ay, my good lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Then let me see thy cloak:</line>
            <line>I'll get me one of such another length.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?</line>
            <line>I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.</line>
            <line>What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!</line>
            <line>And here an engine fit for my proceeding.</line>
            <line>I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.</line>
            <stagedir>Reads</stagedir>
            <line>'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,</line>
            <line>And slaves they are to me that send them flying:</line>
            <line>O, could their master come and go as lightly,</line>
            <line>Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!</line>

            <line>Thank me for this more than for all the favours</line>
            <line>Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.</line>
            <line>But if thou linger in my territories</line>
            <line>Longer than swiftest expedition</line>
            <line>Will give thee time to leave our royal court,</line>
            <line>By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love</line>
            <line>I ever bore my daughter or thyself.</line>
            <line>Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;</line>

            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>The best way is to slander Valentine</line>

            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Ay, if his enemy deliver it:</line>
            <line>Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken</line>
            <line>By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Then you must undertake to slander him.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:</line>
            <line>'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,</line>
            <line>Especially against his very friend.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Where your good word cannot advantage him,</line>
            <line>Your slander never can endamage him;</line>
            <line>Therefore the office is indifferent,</line>
            <line>Being entreated to it by your friend.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it</line>
            <line>By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,</line>
            <line>She shall not long continue love to him.</line>
            <line>But say this weed her love from Valentine,</line>
            <line>It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THURIO</speaker>

            <line>Lest it should ravel and be good to none,</line>
            <line>You must provide to bottom it on me;</line>
            <line>Which must be done by praising me as much</line>

            <line>Where you with Silvia may confer at large;</line>
            <line>For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,</line>
            <line>And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;</line>
            <line>Where you may temper her by your persuasion</line>
            <line>To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>As much as I can do, I will effect:</line>
            <line>But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;</line>
            <line>You must lay lime to tangle her desires</line>
            <line>By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes</line>
            <line>Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>Ay,</line>
            <line>Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Say that upon the altar of her beauty</line>
            <line>You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:</line>
            <line>Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears</line>
            <line>Moist it again, and frame some feeling line</line>
            <line>That may discover such integrity:</line>
            <line>For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,</line>
            <line>Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,</line>
            <line>Make tigers tame and huge leviathans</line>
            <line>Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.</line>
            <line>After your dire-lamenting elegies,</line>
            <line>Visit by night your lady's chamber-window</line>
            <line>With some sweet concert; to their instruments</line>
            <line>Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence</line>
            <line>Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.</line>
            <line>This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
            <line>This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THURIO</speaker>
            <line>And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.</line>
            <line>Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,</line>
            <line>Let us into the city presently</line>
            <line>To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.</line>

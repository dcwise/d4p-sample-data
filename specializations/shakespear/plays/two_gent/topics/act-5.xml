            <line>Why then,</line>
            <line>She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;</line>
            <line>And Eglamour is in her company.</line>
            <line>'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,</line>
            <line>As he in penance wander'd through the forest;</line>
            <line>Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,</line>
            <line>But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;</line>
            <line>Besides, she did intend confession</line>
            <line>At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;</line>
            <line>These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.</line>
            <line>Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,</line>
            <line>But mount you presently and meet with me</line>
            <line>Upon the rising of the mountain-foot</line>
            <line>That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:</line>
            <line>Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.</line>

            <line>Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,</line>
            <line>That flies her fortune when it follows her.</line>
            <line>I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>And I will follow, more for Silvia's love</line>

            <line>Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,</line>
            <line>For such is a friend now; treacherous man!</line>
            <line>Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye</line>
            <line>Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say</line>
            <line>I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.</line>
            <line>Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand</line>
            <line>Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,</line>
            <line>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,</line>
            <line>But count the world a stranger for thy sake.</line>
            <line>The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,</line>

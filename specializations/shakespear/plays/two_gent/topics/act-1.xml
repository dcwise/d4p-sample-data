         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:</line>
            <line>Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.</line>
            <line>Were't not affection chains thy tender days</line>
            <line>To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,</line>
            <line>I rather would entreat thy company</line>
            <line>To see the wonders of the world abroad,</line>
            <line>Than, living dully sluggardized at home,</line>
            <line>Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</line>
            <line>But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,</line>
            <line>Even as I would when I to love begin.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!</line>
            <line>Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest</line>
            <line>Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:</line>
            <line>Wish me partaker in thy happiness</line>
            <line>When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,</line>
            <line>If ever danger do environ thee,</line>
            <line>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</line>
            <line>For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>And on a love-book pray for my success?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>That's on some shallow story of deep love:</line>
            <line>How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>That's a deep story of a deeper love:</line>
            <line>For he was more than over shoes in love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,</line>
            <line>And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>What?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;</line>
            <line>Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth</line>
            <line>With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:</line>
            <line>If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;</line>
            <line>If lost, why then a grievous labour won;</line>
            <line>However, but a folly bought with wit,</line>
            <line>Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>Love is your master, for he masters you:</line>
            <line>And he that is so yoked by a fool,</line>
            <line>Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud</line>
            <line>The eating canker dwells, so eating love</line>
            <line>Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VALENTINE</speaker>
            <line>And writers say, as the most forward bud</line>
            <line>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</line>
            <line>Even so by love the young and tender wit</line>
            <line>Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,</line>
            <line>Losing his verdure even in the prime</line>
            <line>And all the fair effects of future hopes.</line>
            <line>But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,</line>
            <line>That art a votary to fond desire?</line>
            <line>Once more adieu! my father at the road</line>
            <line>Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</line>

            <line>To Milan let me hear from thee by letters</line>
            <line>Of thy success in love, and what news else</line>
            <line>Betideth here in absence of thy friend;</line>
            <line>And likewise will visit thee with mine.</line>

            <line>Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,</line>
            <line>Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,</line>

            <line>True; and thy master a shepherd.</line>

            <line>Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,</line>

            <line>Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;</line>
            <line>Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.</line>
            <line>O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,</line>
            <line>To seal our happiness with their consents!</line>
            <line>O heavenly Julia!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>There is no news, my lord, but that he writes</line>
            <line>How happily he lives, how well beloved</line>
            <line>And daily graced by the emperor;</line>
            <line>Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>My will is something sorted with his wish.</line>
            <line>Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;</line>
            <line>For what I will, I will, and there an end.</line>
            <line>I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time</line>
            <line>With Valentinus in the emperor's court:</line>
            <line>What maintenance he from his friends receives,</line>
            <line>Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.</line>
            <line>To-morrow be in readiness to go:</line>
            <line>Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.</line>

            <line>Please you, deliberate a day or two.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,</line>
            <line>And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.</line>
            <line>I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,</line>
            <line>Lest he should take exceptions to my love;</line>
            <line>And with the vantage of mine own excuse</line>
            <line>Hath he excepted most against my love.</line>
            <line>O, how this spring of love resembleth</line>
            <line>The uncertain glory of an April day,</line>
            <line>Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,</line>
            <line>And by and by a cloud takes all away!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PROTEUS</speaker>
            <line>Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,</line>
            <line>And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'</line>

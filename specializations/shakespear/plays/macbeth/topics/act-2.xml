            <line>A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,</line>

            <stagedir>Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch</stagedir>
            <line>Give me my sword.</line>

            <line>What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:</line>
            <line>He hath been in unusual pleasure, and</line>
            <line>Sent forth great largess to your offices.</line>
            <line>This diamond he greets your wife withal,</line>
            <line>By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up</line>

            <line>Being unprepared,</line>

            <speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
            <line>All's well.</line>
            <line>I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:</line>
            <line>To you they have show'd some truth.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>I think not of them:</line>
            <line>Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,</line>
            <line>We would spend it in some words upon that business,</line>
            <line>If you would grant the time.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
            <line>At your kind'st leisure.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,</line>
            <line>It shall make honour for you.</line>

            <speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
            <line>So I lose none</line>
            <line>In seeking to augment it, but still keep</line>
            <line>My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,</line>
            <line>I shall be counsell'd.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,</line>
            <line>She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit Servant</stagedir>
            <line>Is this a dagger which I see before me,</line>
            <line>The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.</line>
            <line>I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.</line>
            <line>Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible</line>
            <line>To feeling as to sight? or art thou but</line>
            <line>A dagger of the mind, a false creation,</line>
            <line>Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?</line>
            <line>I see thee yet, in form as palpable</line>
            <line>As this which now I draw.</line>
            <line>Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;</line>
            <line>And such an instrument I was to use.</line>
            <line>Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,</line>
            <line>Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,</line>
            <line>And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</line>
            <line>Which was not so before. There's no such thing:</line>
            <line>It is the bloody business which informs</line>
            <line>Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld</line>
            <line>Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse</line>
            <line>The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates</line>
            <line>Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,</line>
            <line>Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,</line>
            <line>Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.</line>
            <line>With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design</line>
            <line>Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,</line>
            <line>Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear</line>
            <line>Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,</line>
            <line>And take the present horror from the time,</line>
            <line>Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:</line>
            <line>Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.</line>
            <stagedir>A bell rings</stagedir>
            <line>I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.</line>
            <line>Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell</line>
            <line>That summons thee to heaven or to hell.</line>

            <line>Your face, my thane, is as a book where men</line>
            <line>May read strange matters. To beguile the time,</line>
            <line>Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,</line>
            <line>Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,</line>
            <line>But be the serpent under't. He that's coming</line>
            <line>Must be provided for: and you shall put</line>
            <line>This night's great business into my dispatch;</line>
            <line>Which shall to all our nights and days to come</line>
            <line>Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.</line>

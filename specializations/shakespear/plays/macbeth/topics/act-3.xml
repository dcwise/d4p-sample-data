            <line>Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,</line>
            <line>As the weird women promised, and, I fear,</line>
            <line>Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said</line>
            <line>It should not stand in thy posterity,</line>
            <line>But that myself should be the root and father</line>
            <line>Of many kings. If there come truth from them--</line>
            <line>As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--</line>
            <line>Why, by the verities on thee made good,</line>
            <line>May they not be my oracles as well,</line>
            <line>And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.</line>

            <line>We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd</line>
            <line>In England and in Ireland, not confessing</line>

            <line>To be thus is nothing;</line>
            <line>But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo</line>
            <line>Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature</line>
            <line>Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;</line>
            <line>And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,</line>
            <line>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour</line>
            <line>To act in safety. There is none but he</line>
            <line>Whose being I do fear: and, under him,</line>
            <line>My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,</line>
            <line>Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters</line>
            <line>When first they put the name of king upon me,</line>
            <line>And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like</line>
            <line>They hail'd him father to a line of kings:</line>
            <line>Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,</line>
            <line>And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</line>
            <line>Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,</line>
            <line>No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,</line>
            <line>For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;</line>
            <line>For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;</line>
            <line>Put rancours in the vessel of my peace</line>
            <line>Only for them; and mine eternal jewel</line>
            <line>Given to the common enemy of man,</line>
            <line>To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!</line>
            <line>Rather than so, come fate into the list.</line>
            <line>And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!</line>
            <stagedir>Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers</stagedir>
            <line>Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.</line>

            <speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>Well then, now</line>
            <line>Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know</line>
            <line>That it was he in the times past which held you</line>
            <line>So under fortune, which you thought had been</line>
            <line>Our innocent self: this I made good to you</line>
            <line>In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,</line>
            <line>How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,</line>
            <line>the instruments,</line>
            <line>Who wrought with them, and all things else that might</line>
            <line>To half a soul and to a notion crazed</line>
            <line>Say 'Thus did Banquo.'</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
            <line>You made it known to us.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>I did so, and went further, which is now</line>
            <line>Our point of second meeting. Do you find</line>
            <line>Your patience so predominant in your nature</line>
            <line>That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd</line>
            <line>To pray for this good man and for his issue,</line>
            <line>Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave</line>
            <line>And beggar'd yours for ever?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
            <line>We are men, my liege.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;</line>
            <line>As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,</line>
            <line>Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept</line>
            <line>All by the name of dogs: the valued file</line>
            <line>Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,</line>
            <line>The housekeeper, the hunter, every one</line>
            <line>According to the gift which bounteous nature</line>
            <line>Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive</line>
            <line>Particular addition. from the bill</line>
            <line>That writes them all alike: and so of men.</line>
            <line>Now, if you have a station in the file,</line>
            <line>Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;</line>
            <line>And I will put that business in your bosoms,</line>
            <line>Whose execution takes your enemy off,</line>
            <line>Grapples you to the heart and love of us,</line>
            <line>Who wear our health but sickly in his life,</line>
            <line>Which in his death were perfect.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
            <line>I am one, my liege,</line>
            <line>Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world</line>
            <line>Have so incensed that I am reckless what</line>
            <line>I do to spite the world.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
            <line>And I another</line>
            <line>So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,</line>
            <line>That I would set my lie on any chance,</line>
            <line>To mend it, or be rid on't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
            <line>So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,</line>
            <line>That every minute of his being thrusts</line>
            <line>Against my near'st of life: and though I could</line>
            <line>With barefaced power sweep him from my sight</line>
            <line>And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</line>
            <line>For certain friends that are both his and mine,</line>
            <line>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall</line>
            <line>Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,</line>
            <line>That I to your assistance do make love,</line>
            <line>Masking the business from the common eye</line>
            <line>For sundry weighty reasons.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
            <line>We shall, my lord,</line>

            <line>The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,</line>
            <line>And something from the palace; always thought</line>
            <line>That I require a clearness: and with him--</line>
            <line>To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--</line>
            <line>Fleance his son, that keeps him company,</line>
            <line>Whose absence is no less material to me</line>
            <line>Than is his father's, must embrace the fate</line>
            <line>Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:</line>

            <line>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,</line>
            <line>Which can interpret further: only, I say,</line>
            <line>Things have been strangely borne. The</line>
            <line>gracious Duncan</line>
            <line>Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:</line>
            <line>And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;</line>
            <line>Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,</line>
            <line>For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.</line>
            <line>Who cannot want the thought how monstrous</line>
            <line>It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain</line>
            <line>To kill their gracious father? damned fact!</line>

            <line>That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?</line>
            <line>Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;</line>
            <line>For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive</line>
            <line>To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,</line>
            <line>He has borne all things well: and I do think</line>

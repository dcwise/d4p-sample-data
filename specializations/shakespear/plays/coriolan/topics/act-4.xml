            <line>With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,</line>
            <line>Where is your ancient courage? you were used</line>

            <line>That when the sea was calm all boats alike</line>

            <line>He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth</line>

            <line>question asked him by any of the senators, but they</line>
            <line>stand bald before him: our general himself makes a</line>
            <line>mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and</line>
            <line>turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But</line>
            <line>the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'</line>
            <line>the middle and but one half of what he was</line>
            <line>yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty</line>
            <line>and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,</line>
            <line>and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he</line>
            <line>will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Servingman</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Servingman</speaker>
            <line>Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as</line>

            <line>Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as</line>
            <line>day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and</line>
            <line>full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;</line>
            <line>mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Servingman</speaker>
            <line>'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to</line>

            <line>All places yield to him ere he sits down;</line>
            <line>And the nobility of Rome are his:</line>
            <line>The senators and patricians love him too:</line>
            <line>The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people</line>
            <line>Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty</line>
            <line>To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome</line>
            <line>As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</line>
            <line>By sovereignty of nature. First he was</line>
            <line>A noble servant to them; but he could not</line>
            <line>Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,</line>
            <line>Which out of daily fortune ever taints</line>
            <line>The happy man; whether defect of judgment,</line>
            <line>To fail in the disposing of those chances</line>
            <line>Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</line>
            <line>Not to be other than one thing, not moving</line>
            <line>From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace</line>
            <line>Even with the same austerity and garb</line>
            <line>As he controll'd the war; but one of these--</line>
            <line>As he hath spices of them all, not all,</line>
            <line>For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,</line>
            <line>So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,</line>
            <line>To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues</line>

            <line>And power, unto itself most commendable,</line>
            <line>Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</line>
            <line>To extol what it hath done.</line>
            <line>One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</line>

            <line>Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>All</speaker>
            <line>Speak, speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>All</speaker>
            <line>Resolved. resolved.</line>

            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>All</speaker>
            <line>We know't, we know't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.</line>
            <line>Is't a verdict?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>All</speaker>
            <line>No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!</line>

            <speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
            <line>One word, good citizens.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.</line>
            <line>What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they</line>
            <line>would yield us but the superfluity, while it were</line>
            <line>wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;</line>
            <line>but they think we are too dear: the leanness that</line>
            <line>afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an</line>
            <line>inventory to particularise their abundance; our</line>
            <line>sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with</line>
            <line>our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I</line>
            <line>speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>All</speaker>
            <line>Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Very well; and could be content to give him good</line>
            <line>report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Nay, but speak not maliciously.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did</line>
            <line>it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be</line>
            <line>content to say it was for his country he did it to</line>
            <line>please his mother and to be partly proud; which he</line>
            <line>is, even till the altitude of his virtue.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
            <line>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a</line>
            <line>vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;</line>
            <line>he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.</line>
            <stagedir>Shouts within</stagedir>
            <line>What shouts are these? The other side o' the city</line>
            <line>is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>All</speaker>
            <line>Come, come.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Soft! who comes here?</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved</line>
            <line>the people.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you</line>
            <line>With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have</line>
            <line>had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,</line>
            <line>which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor</line>
            <line>suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we</line>
            <line>have strong arms too.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,</line>
            <line>Will you undo yourselves?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>I tell you, friends, most charitable care</line>
            <line>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</line>
            <line>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</line>
            <line>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</line>
            <line>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</line>
            <line>The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</line>
            <line>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</line>
            <line>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</line>
            <line>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</line>
            <line>Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,</line>
            <line>You are transported by calamity</line>
            <line>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</line>
            <line>The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,</line>
            <line>When you curse them as enemies.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us</line>
            <line>yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses</line>
            <line>crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to</line>
            <line>support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act</line>
            <line>established against the rich, and provide more</line>
            <line>piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain</line>
            <line>the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and</line>
            <line>there's all the love they bear us.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Either you must</line>
            <line>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,</line>
            <line>Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you</line>
            <line>A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;</line>
            <line>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture</line>
            <line>To stale 't a little more.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to</line>
            <line>fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please</line>
            <line>you, deliver.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>There was a time when all the body's members</line>
            <line>Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:</line>
            <line>That only like a gulf it did remain</line>
            <line>I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,</line>
            <line>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</line>
            <line>Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments</line>
            <line>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</line>
            <line>And, mutually participate, did minister</line>
            <line>Unto the appetite and affection common</line>
            <line>Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</line>
            <line>Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--</line>
            <line>For, look you, I may make the belly smile</line>
            <line>As well as speak--it tauntingly replied</line>
            <line>To the discontented members, the mutinous parts</line>
            <line>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</line>
            <line>As you malign our senators for that</line>
            <line>They are not such as you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Your belly's answer? What!</line>
            <line>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,</line>
            <line>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</line>
            <line>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.</line>
            <line>With other muniments and petty helps</line>
            <line>In this our fabric, if that they--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>What then?</line>
            <line>'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,</line>
            <line>Who is the sink o' the body,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Well, what then?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>The former agents, if they did complain,</line>
            <line>What could the belly answer?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>I will tell you</line>
            <line>If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--</line>
            <line>Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Ye're long about it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>Note me this, good friend;</line>
            <line>Your most grave belly was deliberate,</line>
            <line>Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:</line>
            <line>'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,</line>
            <line>'That I receive the general food at first,</line>
            <line>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</line>
            <line>Because I am the store-house and the shop</line>
            <line>Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,</line>
            <line>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</line>
            <line>Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;</line>
            <line>And, through the cranks and offices of man,</line>
            <line>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</line>
            <line>From me receive that natural competency</line>
            <line>Whereby they live: and though that all at once,</line>
            <line>You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>Ay, sir; well, well.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>'Though all at once cannot</line>
            <line>See what I do deliver out to each,</line>
            <line>Yet I can make my audit up, that all</line>
            <line>From me do back receive the flour of all,</line>
            <line>And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>It was an answer: how apply you this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</line>
            <line>And you the mutinous members; for examine</line>
            <line>Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly</line>
            <line>Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find</line>
            <line>No public benefit which you receive</line>
            <line>But it proceeds or comes from them to you</line>
            <line>And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</line>
            <line>You, the great toe of this assembly?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>I the great toe! why the great toe?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,</line>
            <line>Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:</line>
            <line>Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</line>
            <line>Lead'st first to win some vantage.</line>
            <line>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:</line>
            <line>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;</line>
            <line>The one side must have bale.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter CAIUS MARCIUS</stagedir>
            <line>Hail, noble Marcius!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,</line>
            <line>That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,</line>
            <line>Make yourselves scabs?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
            <line>We have ever your good word.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCIUS</speaker>
            <line>He that will give good words to thee will flatter</line>
            <line>Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</line>
            <line>That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,</line>
            <line>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</line>
            <line>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</line>
            <line>Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,</line>
            <line>Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,</line>
            <line>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</line>
            <line>To make him worthy whose offence subdues him</line>
            <line>And curse that justice did it.</line>
            <line>Who deserves greatness</line>
            <line>Deserves your hate; and your affections are</line>
            <line>A sick man's appetite, who desires most that</line>
            <line>Which would increase his evil. He that depends</line>
            <line>Upon your favours swims with fins of lead</line>
            <line>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?</line>
            <line>With every minute you do change a mind,</line>
            <line>And call him noble that was now your hate,</line>
            <line>Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,</line>
            <line>That in these several places of the city</line>
            <line>You cry against the noble senate, who,</line>
            <line>Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else</line>
            <line>Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MENENIUS</speaker>
            <line>For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,</line>
            <line>The city is well stored.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Hang 'em! They say!</line>
            <line>They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know</line>
            <line>What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,</line>

         <stagedir>Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a
Messenger</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon</line>
            <line>comes this night to Messina.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off</line>
            <line>when I left him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>But few of any sort, and none of name.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings</line>
            <line>home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath</line>
            <line>bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by</line>
            <line>Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the</line>
            <line>promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,</line>
            <line>the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better</line>
            <line>bettered expectation than you must expect of me to</line>
            <line>tell you how.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much</line>
            <line>glad of it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>I have already delivered him letters, and there</line>
            <line>appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could</line>
            <line>not show itself modest enough without a badge of</line>
            <line>bitterness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Did he break out into tears?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>In great measure.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces</line>
            <line>truer than those that are so washed. How much</line>
            <line>better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the</line>
            <line>wars or no?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>I know none of that name, lady: there was none such</line>
            <line>in the army of any sort.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>What is he that you ask for, niece?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged</line>
            <line>Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading</line>
            <line>the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged</line>
            <line>him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he</line>
            <line>killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath</line>
            <line>he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;</line>
            <line>but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:</line>
            <line>he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an</line>
            <line>excellent stomach.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>And a good soldier too, lady.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all</line>
            <line>honourable virtues.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:</line>
            <line>but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a</line>
            <line>kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:</line>
            <line>they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit</line>
            <line>between them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last</line>
            <line>conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and</line>
            <line>now is the whole man governed with one: so that if</line>
            <line>he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him</line>
            <line>bear it for a difference between himself and his</line>
            <line>horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,</line>
            <line>to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his</line>
            <line>companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>Is't possible?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as</line>
            <line>the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the</line>
            <line>next block.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray</line>
            <line>you, who is his companion? Is there no young</line>
            <line>squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he</line>
            <line>is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker</line>
            <line>runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if</line>
            <line>he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a</line>
            <line>thousand pound ere a' be cured.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>I will hold friends with you, lady.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Do, good friend.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>You will never run mad, niece.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>No, not till a hot January.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>Don Pedro is approached.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,
and BALTHASAR</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your</line>
            <line>trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid</line>
            <line>cost, and you encounter it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of</line>
            <line>your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should</line>
            <line>remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides</line>
            <line>and happiness takes his leave.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this</line>
            <line>is your daughter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Her mother hath many times told me so.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this</line>
            <line>what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers</line>
            <line>herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an</line>
            <line>honourable father.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not</line>
            <line>have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as</line>
            <line>like him as she is.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior</line>
            <line>Benedick: nobody marks you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath</line>
            <line>such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?</line>
            <line>Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come</line>
            <line>in her presence.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I</line>
            <line>am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I</line>
            <line>would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard</line>
            <line>heart; for, truly, I love none.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>A dear happiness to women: they would else have</line>
            <line>been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God</line>
            <line>and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I</line>
            <line>had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man</line>
            <line>swear he loves me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some</line>
            <line>gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate</line>
            <line>scratched face.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such</line>
            <line>a face as yours were.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and</line>
            <line>so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's</line>
            <line>name; I have done.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio</line>
            <line>and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath</line>
            <line>invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at</line>
            <line>the least a month; and he heartily prays some</line>
            <line>occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no</line>
            <line>hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.</line>
            <stagedir>To DON JOHN</stagedir>
            <line>Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to</line>
            <line>the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
            <line>I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank</line>
            <line>you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Please it your grace lead on?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>I noted her not; but I looked on her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Is she not a modest young lady?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for</line>
            <line>my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak</line>
            <line>after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high</line>
            <line>praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little</line>
            <line>for a great praise: only this commendation I can</line>
            <line>afford her, that were she other than she is, she</line>
            <line>were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I</line>
            <line>do not like her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me</line>
            <line>truly how thou likest her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Can the world buy such a jewel?</line>
         </speech>

            <line>Yea, but you must not make the full show of this</line>
            <line>till you may do it without controlment. You have of</line>
            <line>late stood out against your brother, and he hath</line>
            <line>ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is</line>
            <line>impossible you should take true root but by the</line>
            <line>fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful</line>
            <line>that you frame the season for your own harvest.</line>

            <line>I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in</line>
            <line>his grace, and it better fits my blood to be</line>
            <line>disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob</line>
            <line>love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to</line>
            <line>be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied</line>
            <line>but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with</line>
            <line>a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I</line>
            <line>have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my</line>
            <line>mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do</line>
            <line>my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and</line>
            <line>seek not to alter me.</line>

            <line>I make all use of it, for I use it only.</line>

            <line>I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your</line>

            <line>can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.</line>

            <speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
            <line>Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a</line>
            <line>musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand</line>
            <line>in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the</line>
            <line>arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the</line>
            <line>prince should woo Hero for himself, and having</line>
            <line>obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.</line>

            <line>Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to</line>
            <line>my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the</line>
            <line>glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I</line>
            <line>bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?</line>

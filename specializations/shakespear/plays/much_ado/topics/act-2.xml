      <scene-body>
         <stagedir>Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Was not Count John here at supper?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>I saw him not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see</line>
            <line>him but I am heart-burned an hour after.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>He is of a very melancholy disposition.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>He were an excellent man that were made just in the</line>
            <line>midway between him and Benedick: the one is too</line>
            <line>like an image and says nothing, and the other too</line>
            <line>like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's</line>
            <line>mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior</line>
            <line>Benedick's face,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money</line>
            <line>enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman</line>
            <line>in the world, if a' could get her good-will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a</line>
            <line>husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>In faith, she's too curst.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's</line>
            <line>sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst</line>
            <line>cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Just, if he send me no husband; for the which</line>
            <line>blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and</line>
            <line>evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a</line>
            <line>beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>You may light on a husband that hath no beard.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel</line>
            <line>and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a</line>
            <line>beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no</line>
            <line>beard is less than a man: and he that is more than</line>
            <line>a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a</line>
            <line>man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take</line>
            <line>sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his</line>
            <line>apes into hell.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Well, then, go you into hell?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet</line>
            <line>me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and</line>
            <line>say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to</line>
            <line>heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver</line>
            <line>I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the</line>
            <line>heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and</line>
            <line>there live we as merry as the day is long.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>To HERO</stagedir>  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled</line>
            <line>by your father.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy</line>
            <line>and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all</line>
            <line>that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else</line>
            <line>make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please</line>
            <line>me.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Not till God make men of some other metal than</line>
            <line>earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be</line>
            <line>overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make</line>
            <line>an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?</line>
            <line>No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;</line>
            <line>and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince</line>
            <line>do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be</line>
            <line>not wooed in good time: if the prince be too</line>
            <line>important, tell him there is measure in every thing</line>
            <line>and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:</line>
            <line>wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,</line>
            <line>a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot</line>
            <line>and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as</line>
            <line>fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a</line>
            <line>measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes</line>
            <line>repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the</line>
            <line>cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>All put on their masks</stagedir>
         <stagedir>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR,
DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked</stagedir>

            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>Lady, will you walk about with your friend?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,</line>
            <line>I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>With me in your company?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>I may say so, when I please.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>And when please you to say so?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>When I like your favour; for God defend the lute</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>Why, then, your visor should be thatched.</line>

            <line>I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.</line>

            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>At a word, I am not.</line>

            <line>You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were</line>
            <line>the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you</line>

            <line>Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your</line>

         <speech>

            <line>Not now.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit</line>
            <line>out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was</line>
            <line>Signior Benedick that said so.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>What's he?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>I am sure you know him well enough.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>Not I, believe me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Did he never make you laugh?</line>

            <line>I pray you, what is he?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;</line>
            <line>only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:</line>
            <line>none but libertines delight in him; and the</line>
            <line>commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;</line>
            <line>for he both pleases men and angers them, and then</line>
            <line>they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in</line>
            <line>the fleet: I would he had boarded me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;</line>
            <line>which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,</line>
            <line>strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a</line>
            <line>partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no</line>
            <line>supper that night.</line>
            <stagedir>Music</stagedir>
            <line>We must follow the leaders.</line>

            <speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
            <line>Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at</line>

         <stagedir>Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO,

            <line>Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath</line>

            <line>The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
            <line>And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
            <line>Are not you Signior Benedick?</line>

            <speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
            <line>Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:</line>
            <line>he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him</line>
            <line>from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may</line>
            <line>do the part of an honest man in it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>How know you he loves her?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
            <line>I heard him swear his affection.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>

            <line>but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go</line>
            <line>dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of</line>
            <line>Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior</line>
            <line>Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of</line>
            <line>affection the one with the other. I would fain have</line>

            <line>strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I</line>
            <line>will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she</line>
            <line>shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your</line>
            <line>two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in</line>
            <line>despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he</line>
            <line>shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,</line>
            <line>Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be</line>

            <line>hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me</line>
            <line>Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night</line>

            <line>will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be</line>
            <line>absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth</line>

            <line>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much</line>
            <line>another man is a fool when he dedicates his</line>
            <line>behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at</line>
            <line>such shallow follies in others, become the argument</line>
            <line>of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man</line>
            <line>is Claudio. I have known when there was no music</line>
            <line>with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he</line>
            <line>rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known</line>
            <line>when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a</line>
            <line>good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,</line>
            <line>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to</line>
            <line>speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man</line>
            <line>and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his</line>
            <line>words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many</line>
            <line>strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with</line>
            <line>these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not</line>

            <line>I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster</line>
            <line>of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman</line>

            <line>O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of</line>
            <line>passion came so near the life of passion as she</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>Why, what effects of passion shows she?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard</line>
            <line>my daughter tell you how.</line>
         </speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I</line>
            <line>thought her spirit had been invincible against all</line>
            <line>assaults of affection.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
            <line>I should think this a gull, but that the</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall</line>
            <line>I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him</line>
            <line>with scorn, write to him that I love him?'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>This says she now when she is beginning to write to</line>
            <line>him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and</line>
            <line>there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a</line>
            <line>sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a</line>
            <line>pretty jest your daughter told us of.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she</line>
            <line>found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>That.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;</line>
            <line>railed at herself, that she should be so immodest</line>
            <line>to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I</line>
            <line>measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I</line>
            <line>should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I</line>
            <line>love him, I should.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,</line>
            <line>beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O</line>
            <line>sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the</line>
            <line>ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter</line>
            <line>is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage</line>
            <line>to herself: it is very true.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>To what end? He would make but a sport of it and</line>
            <line>torment the poor lady worse.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an</line>

            <line>she is virtuous.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>And she is exceeding wise.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>In every thing but in loving Benedick.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender</line>
            <line>a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath</line>
            <line>the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just</line>
            <line>cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would</line>
            <line>have daffed all other respects and made her half</line>
            <line>myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear</line>
            <line>what a' will say.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Were it good, think you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she</line>
            <line>will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere</line>
            <line>she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo</line>
            <line>her, rather than she will bate one breath of her</line>
            <line>accustomed crossness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>She doth well: if she should make tender of her</line>
            <line>love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the</line>
            <line>man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>He is a very proper man.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>And I take him to be valiant.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of</line>
            <line>quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he</line>
            <line>avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes</line>
            <line>them with a most Christian-like fear.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:</line>
            <line>if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a</line>
            <line>quarrel with fear and trembling.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,</line>
            <line>howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests</line>
            <line>he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall</line>
            <line>we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:</line>
            <line>let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I</line>
            <line>could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see</line>
            <line>how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>Let there be the same net spread for her; and that</line>
            <line>must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The</line>
            <line>sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of</line>
            <line>another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the</line>
            <line>scene that I would see, which will be merely a</line>
            <line>dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.</line>

            <line>
               <stagedir>Coming forward</stagedir>  This can be no trick: the</line>
            <line>conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of</line>
            <line>this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it</line>
            <line>seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!</line>
            <line>why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:</line>
            <line>they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive</line>
            <line>the love come from her; they say too that she will</line>
            <line>rather die than give any sign of affection. I did</line>
            <line>never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy</line>
            <line>are they that hear their detractions and can put</line>
            <line>them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a</line>
            <line>truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis</line>
            <line>so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving</line>
            <line>me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor</line>
            <line>no great argument of her folly, for I will be</line>
            <line>horribly in love with her. I may chance have some</line>
            <line>odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,</line>
            <line>because I have railed so long against marriage: but</line>
            <line>doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat</line>
            <line>in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.</line>
            <line>Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of</line>
            <line>the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?</line>
            <line>No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would</line>
            <line>die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I</line>
            <line>were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!</line>
            <line>she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in</line>

            <line>Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's</line>

            <line>Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in</line>
            <line>to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took</line>
            <line>no more pains for those thanks than you took pains</line>
            <line>to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains</line>
            <line>that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do</line>
            <line>not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not</line>

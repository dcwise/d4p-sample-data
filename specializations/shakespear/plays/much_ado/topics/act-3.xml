         <stagedir>Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;</line>
            <line>There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice</line>
            <line>Proposing with the prince and Claudio:</line>
            <line>Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula</line>
            <line>Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse</line>
            <line>Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;</line>
            <line>And bid her steal into the pleached bower,</line>
            <line>Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,</line>
            <line>Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,</line>
            <line>Made proud by princes, that advance their pride</line>
            <line>Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,</line>
            <line>To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;</line>
            <line>Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
            <line>I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,</line>
            <line>As we do trace this alley up and down,</line>
            <line>Our talk must only be of Benedick.</line>
            <line>When I do name him, let it be thy part</line>
            <line>To praise him more than ever man did merit:</line>
            <line>My talk to thee must be how Benedick</line>
            <line>Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter</line>
            <line>Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,</line>
            <line>That only wounds by hearsay.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter BEATRICE, behind</stagedir>
            <line>Now begin;</line>
            <line>For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs</line>
            <line>Close by the ground, to hear our conference.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish</line>
            <line>Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,</line>
            <line>And greedily devour the treacherous bait:</line>
            <line>So angle we for Beatrice; who even now</line>
            <line>Is couched in the woodbine coverture.</line>
            <line>Fear you not my part of the dialogue.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing</line>
            <line>Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.</line>
            <stagedir>Approaching the bower</stagedir>
            <line>No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;</line>
            <line>I know her spirits are as coy and wild</line>
            <line>As haggerds of the rock.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>But are you sure</line>
            <line>That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;</line>
            <line>But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,</line>
            <line>To wish him wrestle with affection,</line>
            <line>And never to let Beatrice know of it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman</line>
            <line>Deserve as full as fortunate a bed</line>
            <line>As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>O god of love! I know he doth deserve</line>
            <line>As much as may be yielded to a man:</line>
            <line>But Nature never framed a woman's heart</line>
            <line>Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;</line>
            <line>Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</line>
            <line>Misprising what they look on, and her wit</line>
            <line>Values itself so highly that to her</line>
            <line>All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,</line>
            <line>Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</line>
            <line>She is so self-endeared.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>Sure, I think so;</line>
            <line>And therefore certainly it were not good</line>
            <line>She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</line>
            <line>How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,</line>
            <line>But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,</line>
            <line>She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</line>
            <line>If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,</line>
            <line>Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</line>
            <line>If low, an agate very vilely cut;</line>
            <line>If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</line>
            <line>If silent, why, a block moved with none.</line>
            <line>So turns she every man the wrong side out</line>
            <line>And never gives to truth and virtue that</line>
            <line>Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions</line>
            <line>As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:</line>
            <line>But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</line>
            <line>She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</line>
            <line>Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</line>
            <line>Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,</line>
            <line>Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:</line>
            <line>It were a better death than die with mocks,</line>
            <line>Which is as bad as die with tickling.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>No; rather I will go to Benedick</line>
            <line>And counsel him to fight against his passion.</line>
            <line>And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders</line>
            <line>To stain my cousin with: one doth not know</line>
            <line>How much an ill word may empoison liking.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.</line>
            <line>She cannot be so much without true judgment--</line>
            <line>Having so swift and excellent a wit</line>
            <line>As she is prized to have--as to refuse</line>
            <line>So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>He is the only man of Italy.</line>
            <line>Always excepted my dear Claudio.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,</line>
            <line>Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,</line>
            <line>For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,</line>
            <line>Goes foremost in report through Italy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.</line>

            <line>His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:</line>
            <line>I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel</line>
            <line>Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>URSULA</speaker>
            <line>She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERO</speaker>
            <line>If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:</line>
            <line>Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.</line>

            <line>What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?</line>
            <line>Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?</line>
            <line>Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!</line>
            <line>No glory lives behind the back of such.</line>
            <line>And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,</line>
            <line>Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:</line>
            <line>If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee</line>
            <line>To bind our loves up in a holy band;</line>
            <line>For others say thou dost deserve, and I</line>
            <line>Believe it better than reportingly.</line>

      <title>SCENE II.  A room in LEONATO'S house</title>

         <stagedir>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and</line>
            <line>then go I toward Arragon.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
            <line>Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss</line>
            <line>of your marriage as to show a child his new coat</line>
            <line>and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold</line>
            <line>with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown</line>
            <line>of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all</line>
            <line>mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's</line>
            <line>bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at</line>
            <line>him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his</line>

            <line>There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be</line>

            <line>shape of two countries at once, as, a German from</line>
            <line>the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from</line>
            <line>the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy</line>
            <line>to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no</line>

            <line>If he be not in love with some woman, there is no</line>

            <line>No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,</line>

            <line>Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of</line>

            <line>Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed</line>
            <line>you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is</line>

            <line>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,</line>

            <line>let that appear when there is no need of such</line>

            <line>senseless and fit man for the constable of the</line>
            <line>watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your</line>

            <line>that decerns you nearly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
            <line>Marry, this it is, sir.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VERGES</speaker>
            <line>Yes, in truth it is, sir.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>What is it, my good friends?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
            <line>Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the</line>
            <line>matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so</line>
            <line>blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,</line>
            <line>in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VERGES</speaker>
            <line>Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living</line>
            <line>that is an old man and no honester than I.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
            <line>Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Neighbours, you are tedious.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
            <line>It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the</line>
            <line>poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,</line>
            <line>if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in</line>
            <line>my heart to bestow it all of your worship.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>All thy tediousness on me, ah?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
            <line>Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for</line>
            <line>I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any</line>
            <line>man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I</line>
            <line>am glad to hear it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VERGES</speaker>
            <line>And so am I.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>I would fain know what you have to say.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VERGES</speaker>
            <line>Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your</line>
            <line>worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant</line>
            <line>knaves as any in Messina.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
            <line>A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they</line>
            <line>say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help</line>
            <line>us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,</line>
            <line>neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men</line>
            <line>ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest</line>
            <line>soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever</line>
            <line>broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men</line>
            <line>are not alike; alas, good neighbour!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.</line>

            <speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
            <line>One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed</line>
            <line>comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would</line>
            <line>have them this morning examined before your worship.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
            <line>Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I</line>
            <line>am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
            <line>It shall be suffigance.</line>

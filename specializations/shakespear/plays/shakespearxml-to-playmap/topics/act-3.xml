            <line>Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;</line>
            <line>Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working.</line>
            <stagedir>SONG</stagedir>
            <line>Orpheus with his lute made trees,</line>
            <line>And the mountain tops that freeze,</line>
            <line>Bow themselves when he did sing:</line>
            <line>To his music plants and flowers</line>
            <line>Ever sprung; as sun and showers</line>
            <line>There had made a lasting spring.</line>
            <line>Every thing that heard him play,</line>
            <line>Even the billows of the sea,</line>
            <line>Hung their heads, and then lay by.</line>
            <line>In sweet music is such art,</line>
            <line>Killing care and grief of heart</line>
            <line>Fall asleep, or hearing, die.</line>

            <line>I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,</line>
            <line>They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:</line>
            <line>But all hoods make not monks.</line>

            <line>Speak it here:</line>
            <line>There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,</line>
            <line>Deserves a corner: would all other women</line>
            <line>Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!</line>
            <line>My lords, I care not, so much I am happy</line>
            <line>Above a number, if my actions</line>
            <line>Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,</line>
            <line>Envy and base opinion set against 'em,</line>
            <line>I know my life so even. If your business</line>
            <line>Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,</line>

            <line>O, good my lord, no Latin;</line>
            <line>I am not such a truant since my coming,</line>
            <line>As not to know the language I have lived in:</line>
            <line>A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,</line>
            <line>suspicious;</line>
            <line>Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,</line>
            <line>If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;</line>
            <line>Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,</line>
            <line>The willing'st sin I ever yet committed</line>
            <line>May be absolved in English.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL WOLSEY</speaker>
            <line>Noble lady,</line>
            <line>I am sorry my integrity should breed,</line>
            <line>And service to his majesty and you,</line>
            <line>So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.</line>
            <line>We come not by the way of accusation,</line>
            <line>To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,</line>
            <line>Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,</line>
            <line>You have too much, good lady; but to know</line>
            <line>How you stand minded in the weighty difference</line>
            <line>Between the king and you; and to deliver,</line>
            <line>Like free and honest men, our just opinions</line>
            <line>And comforts to your cause.</line>

            <line>Most honour'd madam,</line>
            <line>My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,</line>
            <line>Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,</line>
            <line>Forgetting, like a good man your late censure</line>
            <line>Both of his truth and him, which was too far,</line>
            <line>Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,</line>
            <line>His service and his counsel.</line>

               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir> To betray me.--</line>
            <line>My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;</line>
            <line>Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!</line>
            <line>But how to make ye suddenly an answer,</line>
            <line>In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--</line>
            <line>More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,</line>
            <line>And to such men of gravity and learning,</line>
            <line>In truth, I know not. I was set at work</line>
            <line>Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking</line>
            <line>Either for such men or such business.</line>
            <line>For her sake that I have been,--for I feel</line>
            <line>The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,</line>
            <line>Let me have time and counsel for my cause:</line>
            <line>Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL WOLSEY</speaker>
            <line>Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:</line>
            <line>Your hopes and friends are infinite.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN KATHARINE</speaker>
            <line>In England</line>
            <line>But little for my profit: can you think, lords,</line>
            <line>That any Englishman dare give me counsel?</line>
            <line>Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,</line>
            <line>Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,</line>
            <line>And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,</line>
            <line>They that must weigh out my afflictions,</line>
            <line>They that my trust must grow to, live not here:</line>
            <line>They are, as all my other comforts, far hence</line>
            <line>In mine own country, lords.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</speaker>
            <line>I would your grace</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN KATHARINE</speaker>
            <line>How, sir?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</speaker>
            <line>Put your main cause into the king's protection;</line>
            <line>He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much</line>
            <line>Both for your honour better and your cause;</line>
            <line>For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,</line>
            <line>You'll part away disgraced.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN KATHARINE</speaker>
            <line>Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:</line>
            <line>Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!</line>
            <line>Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge</line>
            <line>That no king can corrupt.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</speaker>
            <line>Your rage mistakes us.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN KATHARINE</speaker>
            <line>The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,</line>
            <line>Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;</line>
            <line>But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:</line>
            <line>Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?</line>
            <line>The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,</line>
            <line>A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?</line>
            <line>I will not wish ye half my miseries;</line>
            <line>I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;</line>
            <line>Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once</line>
            <line>The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL WOLSEY</speaker>
            <line>Madam, this is a mere distraction;</line>
            <line>You turn the good we offer into envy.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN KATHARINE</speaker>
            <line>Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye</line>
            <line>And all such false professors! would you have me--</line>
            <line>If you have any justice, any pity;</line>
            <line>If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--</line>
            <line>Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?</line>
            <line>Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,</line>
            <line>His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,</line>
            <line>And all the fellowship I hold now with him</line>
            <line>Is only my obedience. What can happen</line>
            <line>To me above this wretchedness? all your studies</line>
            <line>Make me a curse like this.</line>

            <line>Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,</line>
            <line>Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?</line>
            <line>A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,</line>
            <line>Never yet branded with suspicion?</line>
            <line>Have I with all my full affections</line>
            <line>Still met the king? loved him next heaven?</line>
            <line>obey'd him?</line>
            <line>Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?</line>
            <line>Almost forgot my prayers to content him?</line>
            <line>And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.</line>
            <line>Bring me a constant woman to her husband,</line>
            <line>One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;</line>
            <line>And to that woman, when she has done most,</line>
            <line>Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.</line>

            <speaker>QUEEN KATHARINE</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,</line>
            <line>To give up willingly that noble title</line>
            <line>Your master wed me to: nothing but death</line>
            <line>Shall e'er divorce my dignities.</line>

            <line>Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.</line>
            <line>What will become of me now, wretched lady!</line>
            <line>I am the most unhappy woman living.</line>
            <line>Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!</line>
            <line>Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,</line>
            <line>No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;</line>
            <line>Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,</line>
            <line>That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,</line>

            <line>Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,</line>
            <line>The way of our profession is against it:</line>
            <line>We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.</line>

            <line>How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly</line>
            <line>Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.</line>
            <line>The hearts of princes kiss obedience,</line>
            <line>So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits</line>
            <line>They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.</line>
            <line>I know you have a gentle, noble temper,</line>

            <line>As yours was put into you, ever casts</line>

            <line>You know I am a woman, lacking wit</line>
            <line>To make a seemly answer to such persons.</line>
            <line>Pray, do my service to his majesty:</line>
            <line>He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers</line>

            <line>My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,</line>
            <line>Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could</line>
            <line>My studied purposes requite; which went</line>
            <line>Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours</line>
            <line>Have ever come too short of my desires,</line>
            <line>Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends</line>
            <line>Have been mine so that evermore they pointed</line>
            <line>To the good of your most sacred person and</line>
            <line>The profit of the state. For your great graces</line>
            <line>Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I</line>
            <line>Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,</line>
            <line>My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,</line>
            <line>Which ever has and ever shall be growing,</line>

            <line>A loyal and obedient subject is</line>
            <line>Therein illustrated: the honour of it</line>
            <line>Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,</line>
            <line>The foulness is the punishment. I presume</line>
            <line>That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,</line>
            <line>My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more</line>
            <line>On you than any; so your hand and heart,</line>
            <line>Your brain, and every function of your power,</line>
            <line>Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,</line>
            <line>As 'twere in love's particular, be more</line>

            <line>Though all the world should crack their duty to you,</line>

            <line>Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and</line>
            <line>Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,</line>
            <line>As doth a rock against the chiding flood,</line>

         <stagedir>Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY:

            <speaker>CARDINAL WOLSEY</speaker>
            <line>What should this mean?</line>
            <line>What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?</line>
            <line>He parted frowning from me, as if ruin</line>
            <line>Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion</line>
            <line>Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;</line>
            <line>Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;</line>
            <line>I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;</line>
            <line>This paper has undone me: 'tis the account</line>
            <line>Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together</line>
            <line>For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,</line>
            <line>And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!</line>
            <line>Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil</line>
            <line>Made me put this main secret in the packet</line>
            <line>I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?</line>
            <line>No new device to beat this from his brains?</line>
            <line>I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know</line>
            <line>A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune</line>
            <line>Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'</line>
            <line>The letter, as I live, with all the business</line>
            <line>I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!</line>
            <line>I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;</line>
            <line>And, from that full meridian of my glory,</line>
            <line>I haste now to my setting: I shall fall</line>

            <line>Yes, that goodness</line>

            <line>Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;</line>
            <line>The goodness of your intercepted packets</line>

            <line>Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles</line>

            <line>Speak on, sir;</line>

            <line>I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!</line>
            <line>First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,</line>
            <line>You wrought to be a legate; by which power</line>
            <line>You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else</line>
            <line>To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'</line>
            <line>Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Then that, without the knowledge</line>
            <line>Either of king or council, when you went</line>
            <line>Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold</line>
            <line>To carry into Flanders the great seal.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SURREY</speaker>
            <line>Item, you sent a large commission</line>
            <line>To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,</line>
            <line>Without the king's will or the state's allowance,</line>

         <speech>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SURREY</speaker>
            <line>Then that you have sent innumerable substance--</line>

            <line>To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways</line>
            <line>You have for dignities; to the mere undoing</line>
            <line>Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;</line>
            <line>Which, since they are of you, and odious,</line>
            <line>I will not taint my mouth with.</line>

            <line>His faults lie open to the laws; let them,</line>
            <line>Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him</line>
            <line>So little of his great self.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,</line>
            <line>Because all those things you have done of late,</line>
            <line>By your power legatine, within this kingdom,</line>
            <line>Fall into the compass of a praemunire,</line>
            <line>That therefore such a writ be sued against you;</line>
            <line>To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,</line>
            <line>Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be</line>
            <line>Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
            <line>And so we'll leave you to your meditations</line>
            <line>How to live better. For your stubborn answer</line>
            <line>About the giving back the great seal to us,</line>
            <line>The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.</line>
            <line>So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL WOLSEY</speaker>
            <line>So farewell to the little good you bear me.</line>
            <line>Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!</line>
            <line>This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth</line>
            <line>The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,</line>
            <line>And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;</line>
            <line>The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,</line>
            <line>And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely</line>
            <line>His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,</line>
            <line>And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,</line>
            <line>Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,</line>
            <line>This many summers in a sea of glory,</line>
            <line>But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride</line>
            <line>At length broke under me and now has left me,</line>

            <line>Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.</line>
            <line>Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:</line>
            <line>I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched</line>
            <line>Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!</line>
            <line>There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,</line>
            <line>That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,</line>
            <line>More pangs and fears than wars or women have:</line>
            <line>And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,</line>
            <line>Never to hope again.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed</stagedir>
            <line>Why, how now, Cromwell!</line>

            <line>At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder</line>
            <line>A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,</line>
            <line>I am fall'n indeed.</line>

            <speaker>CARDINAL WOLSEY</speaker>
            <line>Why, well;</line>
            <line>Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.</line>
            <line>I know myself now; and I feel within me</line>
            <line>A peace above all earthly dignities,</line>
            <line>A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,</line>
            <line>I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,</line>
            <line>These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken</line>
            <line>A load would sink a navy, too much honour:</line>
            <line>O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen</line>
            <line>Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CROMWELL</speaker>
            <line>I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.</line>

            <line>I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,</line>
            <line>Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,</line>
            <line>To endure more miseries and greater far</line>
            <line>Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.</line>

            <line>Long in his highness' favour, and do justice</line>
            <line>For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,</line>
            <line>When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,</line>
            <line>May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?</line>

            <line>Last, that the Lady Anne,</line>

            <line>This day was view'd in open as his queen,</line>
            <line>Going to chapel; and the voice is now</line>
            <line>Only about her coronation.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL WOLSEY</speaker>
            <line>There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,</line>
            <line>The king has gone beyond me: all my glories</line>
            <line>In that one woman I have lost for ever:</line>
            <line>No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,</line>
            <line>Or gild again the noble troops that waited</line>
            <line>Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;</line>
            <line>I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now</line>
            <line>To be thy lord and master: seek the king;</line>
            <line>That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him</line>
            <line>What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;</line>
            <line>Some little memory of me will stir him--</line>
            <line>I know his noble nature--not to let</line>
            <line>Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,</line>
            <line>Neglect him not; make use now, and provide</line>
            <line>For thine own future safety.</line>

            <speaker>CROMWELL</speaker>
            <line>O my lord,</line>
            <line>Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego</line>
            <line>So good, so noble and so true a master?</line>
            <line>Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,</line>
            <line>With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.</line>
            <line>The king shall have my service: but my prayers</line>
            <line>For ever and for ever shall be yours.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL WOLSEY</speaker>
            <line>Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear</line>
            <line>In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,</line>
            <line>Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.</line>
            <line>Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;</line>
            <line>And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,</line>
            <line>And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention</line>
            <line>Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,</line>
            <line>Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,</line>
            <line>And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,</line>
            <line>Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;</line>
            <line>A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.</line>
            <line>Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.</line>
            <line>Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:</line>
            <line>By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,</line>
            <line>The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?</line>
            <line>Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;</line>
            <line>Corruption wins not more than honesty.</line>
            <line>Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,</line>
            <line>To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:</line>
            <line>Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,</line>
            <line>Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,</line>
            <line>O Cromwell,</line>
            <line>Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;</line>
            <line>And,--prithee, lead me in:</line>
            <line>There take an inventory of all I have,</line>
            <line>To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,</line>
            <line>And my integrity to heaven, is all</line>
            <line>I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!</line>
            <line>Had I but served my God with half the zeal</line>
            <line>I served my king, he would not in mine age</line>
            <line>Have left me naked to mine enemies.</line>

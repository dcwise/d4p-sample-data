            <line>Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:</line>
            <line>But were I not the better part made mercy,</line>
            <line>I should not seek an absent argument</line>
            <line>Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:</line>
            <line>Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;</line>
            <line>Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living</line>
            <line>Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more</line>
            <line>To seek a living in our territory.</line>
            <line>Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine</line>
            <line>Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,</line>
            <line>Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth</line>
            <line>Of what we think against thee.</line>

            <line>O that your highness knew my heart in this!</line>
            <line>I never loved my brother in my life.</line>

            <line>More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;</line>
            <line>And let my officers of such a nature</line>
            <line>Make an extent upon his house and lands:</line>

            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:</line>
            <line>And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey</line>
            <line>With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,</line>
            <line>Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.</line>
            <line>O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books</line>
            <line>And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;</line>
            <line>That every eye which in this forest looks</line>
            <line>Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.</line>
            <line>Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good</line>
            <line>life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,</line>
            <line>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I</line>
            <line>like it very well; but in respect that it is</line>
            <line>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</line>
            <line>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</line>
            <line>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</line>
            <line>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</line>
            <line>but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</line>
            <line>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>No more but that I know the more one sickens the</line>
            <line>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,</line>
            <line>means and content is without three good friends;</line>
            <line>that the property of rain is to wet and fire to</line>
            <line>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a</line>
            <line>great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that</line>
            <line>he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</line>
            <line>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in</line>
            <line>court, shepherd?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>No, truly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Then thou art damned.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>Nay, I hope.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all</line>
            <line>on one side.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>For not being at court? Your reason.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest</line>
            <line>good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,</line>
            <line>then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is</line>
            <line>sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous</line>
            <line>state, shepherd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners</line>
            <line>at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the</line>
            <line>behavior of the country is most mockable at the</line>
            <line>court. You told me you salute not at the court, but</line>
            <line>you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be</line>
            <line>uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</line>
            <line>fells, you know, are greasy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not</line>
            <line>the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of</line>
            <line>a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>Besides, our hands are hard.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.</line>
            <line>A more sounder instance, come.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of</line>
            <line>our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The</line>
            <line>courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a</line>
            <line>good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and</line>
            <line>perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the</line>
            <line>very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!</line>
            <line>God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORIN</speaker>
            <line>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get</line>
            <line>that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's</line>
            <line>happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my</line>
            <line>harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes</line>
            <line>graze and my lambs suck.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes</line>
            <line>and the rams together and to offer to get your</line>
            <line>living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a</line>
            <line>bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a</line>
            <line>twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,</line>
            <line>out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not</line>
            <line>damned for this, the devil himself will have no</line>
            <line>shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst</line>

            <line>Her worth, being mounted on the wind,</line>

            <line>All the pictures fairest lined</line>

            <line>Let no fair be kept in mind</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and</line>
            <line>suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>For a taste:</line>
            <line>If a hart do lack a hind,</line>
            <line>Let him seek out Rosalind.</line>
            <line>If the cat will after kind,</line>
            <line>So be sure will Rosalind.</line>
            <line>Winter garments must be lined,</line>
            <line>So must slender Rosalind.</line>
            <line>They that reap must sheaf and bind;</line>
            <line>Then to cart with Rosalind.</line>
            <line>Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,</line>
            <line>Such a nut is Rosalind.</line>
            <line>He that sweetest rose will find</line>
            <line>Must find love's prick and Rosalind.</line>
            <line>This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it</line>
            <line>with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit</line>
            <line>i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half</line>

            <line>Why should this a desert be?</line>
            <line>For it is unpeopled? No:</line>
            <line>Tongues I'll hang on every tree,</line>
            <line>That shall civil sayings show:</line>
            <line>Some, how brief the life of man</line>
            <line>Runs his erring pilgrimage,</line>
            <line>That the stretching of a span</line>
            <line>Buckles in his sum of age;</line>
            <line>Some, of violated vows</line>
            <line>'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:</line>

            <line>The quintessence of every sprite</line>
            <line>Heaven would in little show.</line>
            <line>Therefore Heaven Nature charged</line>
            <line>That one body should be fill'd</line>
            <line>With all graces wide-enlarged:</line>
            <line>Nature presently distill'd</line>
            <line>Helen's cheek, but not her heart,</line>
            <line>Cleopatra's majesty,</line>
            <line>Atalanta's better part,</line>
            <line>Sad Lucretia's modesty.</line>
            <line>Thus Rosalind of many parts</line>
            <line>By heavenly synod was devised,</line>
            <line>Of many faces, eyes and hearts,</line>
            <line>To have the touches dearest prized.</line>
            <line>Heaven would that she these gifts should have,</line>

            <line>O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of</line>

            <line>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear</line>

            <line>Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would</line>

            <line>simply your having in beard is a younger brother's</line>

            <line>points in the which women still give the lie to</line>
            <line>their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he</line>

            <line>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves</line>
            <line>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and</line>
            <line>the reason why they are not so punished and cured</line>
            <line>is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers</line>
            <line>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me</line>
            <line>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to</line>
            <line>woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish</line>
            <line>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing</line>
            <line>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,</line>
            <line>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every</line>
            <line>passion something and for no passion truly any</line>
            <line>thing, as boys and women are for the most part</line>
            <line>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe</line>
            <line>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep</line>
            <line>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor</line>
            <line>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of</line>
            <line>madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of</line>
            <line>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.</line>
            <line>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon</line>
            <line>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's</line>
            <line>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.</line>

            <line>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,</line>

            <line>though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are</line>
            <line>necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of</line>
            <line>his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and</line>
            <line>knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of</line>
            <line>his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?</line>
            <line>Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer</line>
            <line>hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man</line>
            <line>therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more</line>

            <line>Did make offence his eye did heal it up.</line>
            <line>He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:</line>

            <line>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</line>
            <line>A little riper and more lusty red</line>

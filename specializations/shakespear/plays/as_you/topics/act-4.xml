            <speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
            <line>I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted</line>
            <line>with thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>They say you are a melancholy fellow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
            <line>I am so; I do love it better than laughing.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Those that are in extremity of either are abominable</line>
            <line>fellows and betray themselves to every modern</line>
            <line>censure worse than drunkards.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
            <line>Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Why then, 'tis good to be a post.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
            <line>I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is</line>
            <line>emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,</line>
            <line>nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the</line>
            <line>soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,</line>
            <line>which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor</line>
            <line>the lover's, which is all these: but it is a</line>
            <line>melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,</line>
            <line>extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's</line>
            <line>contemplation of my travels, in which my often</line>
            <line>rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to</line>
            <line>be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see</line>
            <line>other men's; then, to have seen much and to have</line>
            <line>nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
            <line>Yes, I have gained my experience.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have</line>
            <line>a fool to make me merry than experience to make me</line>
            <line>sad; and to travel for it too!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter ORLANDO</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
            <line>Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and</line>
            <line>wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your</line>
            <line>own country, be out of love with your nativity and</line>
            <line>almost chide God for making you that countenance you</line>
            <line>are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a</line>
            <line>gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been</line>
            <line>all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such</line>
            <line>another trick, never come in my sight more.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Break an hour's promise in love! He that will</line>
            <line>divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but</line>
            <line>a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the</line>
            <line>affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid</line>
            <line>hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant</line>
            <line>him heart-whole.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I</line>
            <line>had as lief be wooed of a snail.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Of a snail?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he</line>
            <line>carries his house on his head; a better jointure,</line>
            <line>I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings</line>
            <line>his destiny with him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>What's that?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be</line>
            <line>beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in</line>
            <line>his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>And I am your Rosalind.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a</line>
            <line>Rosalind of a better leer than you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday</line>
            <line>humour and like enough to consent. What would you</line>
            <line>say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I would kiss before I spoke.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were</line>
            <line>gravelled for lack of matter, you might take</line>
            <line>occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are</line>
            <line>out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God</line>
            <line>warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>How if the kiss be denied?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or</line>
            <line>I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>What, of my suit?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.</line>
            <line>Am not I your Rosalind?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I take some joy to say you are, because I would be</line>
            <line>talking of her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Well in her person I say I will not have you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Then in mine own person I die.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is</line>
            <line>almost six thousand years old, and in all this time</line>
            <line>there was not any man died in his own person,</line>
            <line>videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains</line>
            <line>dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he</line>
            <line>could to die before, and he is one of the patterns</line>
            <line>of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair</line>
            <line>year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been</line>
            <line>for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went</line>
            <line>but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being</line>
            <line>taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish</line>
            <line>coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'</line>
            <line>But these are all lies: men have died from time to</line>
            <line>time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,</line>
            <line>for, I protest, her frown might kill me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now</line>
            <line>I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on</line>
            <line>disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant</line>
            <line>it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Then love me, Rosalind.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>And wilt thou have me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Ay, and twenty such.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>What sayest thou?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Are you not good?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I hope so.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?</line>
            <line>Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.</line>
            <line>Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Pray thee, marry us.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>I cannot say the words.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but when?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Why now; as fast as she can marry us.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>I might ask you for your commission; but I do take</line>
            <line>thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes</line>
            <line>before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought</line>
            <line>runs before her actions.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>So do all thoughts; they are winged.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Now tell me how long you would have her after you</line>
            <line>have possessed her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>For ever and a day.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;</line>
            <line>men are April when they woo, December when they wed:</line>
            <line>maids are May when they are maids, but the sky</line>
            <line>changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous</line>
            <line>of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,</line>
            <line>more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more</line>
            <line>new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires</line>
            <line>than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana</line>
            <line>in the fountain, and I will do that when you are</line>
            <line>disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and</line>
            <line>that when thou art inclined to sleep.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>But will my Rosalind do so?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>By my life, she will do as I do.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>O, but she is wise.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the</line>
            <line>wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's</line>
            <line>wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and</line>
            <line>'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly</line>
            <line>with the smoke out at the chimney.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say</line>
            <line>'Wit, whither wilt?'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met</line>
            <line>your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall</line>
            <line>never take her without her answer, unless you take</line>
            <line>her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot</line>
            <line>make her fault her husband's occasion, let her</line>
            <line>never nurse her child herself, for she will breed</line>
            <line>it like a fool!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>

            <line>When from the first to last betwixt us two</line>
            <line>Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,</line>
            <line>As how I came into that desert place:--</line>
            <line>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</line>
            <line>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</line>
            <line>Committing me unto my brother's love;</line>
            <line>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</line>
            <line>There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm</line>
            <line>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</line>
            <line>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</line>
            <line>And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</line>
            <line>Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;</line>
            <line>And, after some small space, being strong at heart,</line>
            <line>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</line>
            <line>To tell this story, that you might excuse</line>
            <line>His broken promise, and to give this napkin</line>
            <line>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth</line>
            <line>That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,</line>
            <line>'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man</line>
            <line>knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen</line>
            <line>philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,</line>
            <line>would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;</line>
            <line>meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and</line>
            <line>lips to open. You do love this maid?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
            <line>Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it</line>
            <line>is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out</line>
            <line>of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty</line>

            <line>clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better</line>
            <line>understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make</line>
            <line>thee away, translate thy life into death, thy</line>
            <line>liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with</line>
            <line>thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy</line>
            <line>with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with</line>

            <line>and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and</line>
            <line>overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner</line>
            <line>met but they looked, no sooner looked but they</line>
            <line>loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner</line>
            <line>sighed but they asked one another the reason, no</line>
            <line>sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;</line>
            <line>and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs</line>
            <line>to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or</line>
            <line>else be incontinent before marriage: they are in</line>

            <line>is to look into happiness through another man's</line>
            <line>eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at</line>

            <line>I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.</line>
            <line>Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,</line>
            <line>that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I</line>
            <line>speak not this that you should bear a good opinion</line>
            <line>of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;</line>
            <line>neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in</line>
            <line>some little measure draw a belief from you, to do</line>
            <line>yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if</line>
            <line>you please, that I can do strange things: I have,</line>
            <line>since I was three year old, conversed with a</line>
            <line>magician, most profound in his art and yet not</line>
            <line>damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart</line>
            <line>as your gesture cries it out, when your brother</line>
            <line>marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into</line>
            <line>what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is</line>
            <line>not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient</line>
            <line>to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human</line>
            <line>as she is and without any danger.</line>

            <line>By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I</line>
            <line>say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your</line>
            <line>best array: bid your friends; for if you will be</line>

            <line>Let me have audience for a word or two:</line>
            <line>I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,</line>
            <line>That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.</line>
            <line>Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day</line>
            <line>Men of great worth resorted to this forest,</line>
            <line>Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,</line>
            <line>In his own conduct, purposely to take</line>
            <line>His brother here and put him to the sword:</line>
            <line>And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;</line>
            <line>Where meeting with an old religious man,</line>
            <line>After some question with him, was converted</line>
            <line>Both from his enterprise and from the world,</line>
            <line>His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,</line>
            <line>And all their lands restored to them again</line>
            <line>That were with him exiled. This to be true,</line>

            <line>First, in this forest, let us do those ends</line>

            <line>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;</line>
            <line>but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord</line>
            <line>the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs</line>
            <line>no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no</line>
            <line>epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,</line>
            <line>and good plays prove the better by the help of good</line>
            <line>epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am</line>
            <line>neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with</line>
            <line>you in the behalf of a good play! I am not</line>
            <line>furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not</line>
            <line>become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin</line>
            <line>with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love</line>
            <line>you bear to men, to like as much of this play as</line>
            <line>please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love</line>
            <line>you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,</line>
            <line>none of you hates them--that between you and the</line>
            <line>women the play may please. If I were a woman I</line>
            <line>would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased</line>
            <line>me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I</line>
            <line>defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good</line>
            <line>beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my</line>
            <line>kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</line>

         <stagedir>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</line>
            <line>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</line>
            <line>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</line>
            <line>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</line>
            <line>sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</line>
            <line>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</line>
            <line>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</line>
            <line>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</line>
            <line>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</line>
            <line>differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</line>
            <line>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</line>
            <line>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</line>
            <line>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</line>
            <line>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</line>
            <line>which his animals on his dunghills are as much</line>
            <line>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</line>
            <line>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</line>
            <line>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</line>
            <line>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</line>
            <line>brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</line>
            <line>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</line>
            <line>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</line>
            <line>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</line>
            <line>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</line>
            <line>know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</line>

            <line>shake me up.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</line>
            <line>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</line>

            <line>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</line>
            <line>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</line>
            <line>come to such penury?</line>

            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>

            <line>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>Know you before whom, sir?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</line>
            <line>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</line>
            <line>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</line>
            <line>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</line>
            <line>you are the first-born; but the same tradition</line>
            <line>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</line>
            <line>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</line>
            <line>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</line>
            <line>nearer to his reverence.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>What, boy!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</line>
            <line>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</line>
            <line>a villain that says such a father begot villains.</line>
            <line>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</line>
            <line>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</line>
            <line>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADAM</speaker>
            <line>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's</line>
            <line>remembrance, be at accord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>Let me go, I say.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</line>
            <line>father charged you in his will to give me good</line>
            <line>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</line>
            <line>obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</line>
            <line>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</line>
            <line>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</line>
            <line>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</line>
            <line>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</line>
            <line>testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</line>
            <line>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</line>
            <line>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</line>
            <line>pray you, leave me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
            <line>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ADAM</speaker>
            <line>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my</line>
            <line>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!</line>
            <line>he would not have spoke such a word.</line>

            <line>Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the</line>
            <line>new court?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
            <line>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:</line>
            <line>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger</line>
            <line>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords</line>
            <line>have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,</line>
            <line>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;</line>
            <line>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be</line>
            <line>banished with her father?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
            <line>O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves</line>
            <line>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</line>
            <line>that she would have followed her exile, or have died</line>
            <line>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no</line>
            <line>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and</line>
            <line>never two ladies loved as they do.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>Where will the old duke live?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
            <line>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and</line>
            <line>a many merry men with him; and there they live like</line>
            <line>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young</line>
            <line>gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time</line>
            <line>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
            <line>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</line>
            <line>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</line>
            <line>that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition</line>
            <line>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</line>
            <line>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</line>
            <line>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</line>
            <line>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</line>
            <line>for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I</line>
            <line>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,</line>
            <line>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you</line>
            <line>withal, that either you might stay him from his</line>
            <line>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall</line>
            <line>run into, in that it is a thing of his own search</line>
            <line>and altogether against my will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</line>
            <line>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</line>
            <line>myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and</line>
            <line>have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</line>
            <line>it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:</line>
            <line>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</line>
            <line>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's</line>
            <line>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</line>
            <line>me his natural brother: therefore use thy</line>
            <line>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</line>
            <line>as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if</line>
            <line>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</line>
            <line>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</line>
            <line>against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</line>
            <line>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</line>
            <line>hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;</line>
            <line>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</line>
            <line>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</line>
            <line>day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</line>
            <line>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</line>
            <line>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
            <line>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</line>
            <line>to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go</line>
            <line>alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and</line>
            <line>so God keep your worship!</line>

            <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
            <line>Farewell, good Charles.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit CHARLES</stagedir>
            <line>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see</line>
            <line>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</line>
            <line>hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never</line>
            <line>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of</line>
            <line>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much</line>
            <line>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own</line>
            <line>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</line>
            <line>misprised: but it shall not be so long; this</line>
            <line>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that</line>
            <line>I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?</line>
            <line>Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.</line>
            <line>I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>I have more cause.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>Thou hast not, cousin;</line>
            <line>Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke</line>
            <line>Hath banish'd me, his daughter?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>That he hath not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love</line>
            <line>Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:</line>
            <line>Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?</line>
            <line>No: let my father seek another heir.</line>
            <line>Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</line>
            <line>Whither to go and what to bear with us;</line>
            <line>And do not seek to take your change upon you,</line>
            <line>To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;</line>
            <line>For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,</line>
            <line>Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Why, whither shall we go?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Alas, what danger will it be to us,</line>
            <line>Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!</line>
            <line>Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>I'll put myself in poor and mean attire</line>
            <line>And with a kind of umber smirch my face;</line>
            <line>The like do you: so shall we pass along</line>
            <line>And never stir assailants.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>Were it not better,</line>
            <line>Because that I am more than common tall,</line>
            <line>That I did suit me all points like a man?</line>
            <line>A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,</line>
            <line>A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart</line>
            <line>Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--</line>
            <line>We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,</line>
            <line>As many other mannish cowards have</line>
            <line>That do outface it with their semblances.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>What shall I call thee when thou art a man?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;</line>
            <line>And therefore look you call me Ganymede.</line>
            <line>But what will you be call'd?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>Something that hath a reference to my state</line>
            <line>No longer Celia, but Aliena.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
            <line>But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal</line>
            <line>The clownish fool out of your father's court?</line>
            <line>Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CELIA</speaker>
            <line>He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;</line>
            <line>Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,</line>
            <line>And get our jewels and our wealth together,</line>
            <line>Devise the fittest time and safest way</line>
            <line>To hide us from pursuit that will be made</line>
            <line>After my flight. Now go we in content</line>
            <line>To liberty and not to banishment.</line>

            <line>Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles</line>
            <line>Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:</line>
            <line>Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all</line>
            <line>The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,</line>
            <line>And is enough for both.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>First Lord</speaker>
            <line>'Tis our hope, sir,</line>

            <line>No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart</line>
            <line>Will not confess he owes the malady</line>
            <line>That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;</line>
            <line>Whether I live or die, be you the sons</line>
            <line>Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--</line>

            <line>Of the last monarchy,--see that you come</line>
            <line>Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when</line>
            <line>The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,</line>
            <line>That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.</line>

            <line>If they demand: beware of being captives,</line>
            <line>Before you serve.</line>

            <line>Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here</line>
            <line>on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword</line>

            <line>Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.</line>
            <line>I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING</speaker>
            <line>I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,</line>

            <line>O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?</line>
            <line>Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if</line>
            <line>My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine</line>
            <line>That's able to breathe life into a stone,</line>
            <line>Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary</line>
            <line>With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,</line>
            <line>Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,</line>
            <line>To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,</line>

            <line>Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,</line>
            <line>If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,</line>
            <line>If seriously I may convey my thoughts</line>
            <line>In this my light deliverance, I have spoke</line>
            <line>With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,</line>
            <line>Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more</line>
            <line>Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her</line>
            <line>For that is her demand, and know her business?</line>
            <line>That done, laugh well at me.</line>
         </speech>

            <line>By wondering how thou took'st it.</line>

            <line>Nay, come your ways:</line>
            <line>This is his majesty; say your mind to him:</line>
            <line>A traitor you do look like; but such traitors</line>
            <line>His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,</line>

            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Ay, my good lord.</line>
            <line>Gerard de Narbon was my father;</line>
            <line>In what he did profess, well found.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>The rather will I spare my praises towards him:</line>
            <line>Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death</line>
            <line>Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.</line>
            <line>Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,</line>
            <line>And of his old experience the oily darling,</line>
            <line>He bade me store up, as a triple eye,</line>
            <line>Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;</line>
            <line>And hearing your high majesty is touch'd</line>
            <line>With that malignant cause wherein the honour</line>
            <line>Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,</line>
            <line>I come to tender it and my appliance</line>
            <line>With all bound humbleness.</line>

            <speaker>KING</speaker>
            <line>We thank you, maiden;</line>
            <line>But may not be so credulous of cure,</line>
            <line>When our most learned doctors leave us and</line>
            <line>The congregated college have concluded</line>
            <line>That labouring art can never ransom nature</line>
            <line>From her inaidible estate; I say we must not</line>

            <line>To prostitute our past-cure malady</line>
            <line>To empirics, or to dissever so</line>
            <line>Our great self and our credit, to esteem</line>

            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>My duty then shall pay me for my pains:</line>
            <line>I will no more enforce mine office on you.</line>
            <line>Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts</line>
            <line>A modest one, to bear me back a again.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING</speaker>
            <line>I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:</line>
            <line>Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give</line>
            <line>As one near death to those that wish him live:</line>
            <line>But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,</line>

            <line>He that of greatest works is finisher</line>
            <line>Oft does them by the weakest minister:</line>
            <line>So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,</line>
            <line>When judges have been babes; great floods have flown</line>
            <line>From simple sources, and great seas have dried</line>
            <line>When miracles have by the greatest been denied.</line>
            <line>Oft expectation fails and most oft there</line>
            <line>Where most it promises, and oft it hits</line>

            <line>'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which</line>
            <line>I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,</line>
            <line>Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,</line>
            <line>Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off</line>

            <line>A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest</line>
            <line>Of virtue for the name: but do not so:</line>
            <line>From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,</line>
            <line>The place is dignified by the doer's deed:</line>
            <line>Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,</line>
            <line>It is a dropsied honour. Good alone</line>
            <line>Is good without a name. Vileness is so:</line>
            <line>The property by what it is should go,</line>
            <line>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;</line>
            <line>In these to nature she's immediate heir,</line>
            <line>And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,</line>
            <line>Which challenges itself as honour's born</line>
            <line>And is not like the sire: honours thrive,</line>
            <line>When rather from our acts we them derive</line>

            <line>Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave</line>
            <line>A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb</line>
            <line>Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb</line>
            <line>Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?</line>
            <line>If thou canst like this creature as a maid,</line>
            <line>I can create the rest: virtue and she</line>

            <line>It is in us to plant thine honour where</line>

            <line>soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in</line>
            <line>matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them</line>
            <line>tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:</line>
            <line>I have spoken better of you than you have or will to</line>
            <line>deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.</line>

            <line>An idle lord. I swear.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>I think so.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>Yes, I do know him well, and common speech</line>
            <line>Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.</line>

         <stagedir>Enter HELENA</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,</line>
            <line>Spoke with the king and have procured his leave</line>
            <line>For present parting; only he desires</line>
            <line>Some private speech with you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>I shall obey his will.</line>
            <line>You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,</line>
            <line>Which holds not colour with the time, nor does</line>
            <line>The ministration and required office</line>
            <line>On my particular. Prepared I was not</line>
            <line>For such a business; therefore am I found</line>
            <line>So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you</line>
            <line>That presently you take our way for home;</line>
            <line>And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,</line>
            <line>For my respects are better than they seem</line>
            <line>And my appointments have in them a need</line>
            <line>Greater than shows itself at the first view</line>
            <line>To you that know them not. This to my mother:</line>
            <stagedir>Giving a letter</stagedir>
            <line>'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so</line>
            <line>I leave you to your wisdom.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Sir, I can nothing say,</line>
            <line>But that I am your most obedient servant.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>Come, come, no more of that.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>And ever shall</line>
            <line>With true observance seek to eke out that</line>
            <line>Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd</line>
            <line>To equal my great fortune.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>Let that go:</line>
            <line>My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Pray, sir, your pardon.</line>

            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>Well, what would you say?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,</line>
            <line>Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;</line>
            <line>But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal</line>
            <line>What law does vouch mine own.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>What would you have?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.</line>
            <line>I would not tell you what I would, my lord:</line>
            <line>Faith yes;</line>
            <line>Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.</line>

            <line>Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit HELENA</stagedir>
            <line>Go thou toward home; where I will never come</line>
            <line>Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.</line>
            <line>Away, and for our flight.</line>

         <stagedir>Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
and LAFEU, all in black</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
            <line>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death</line>
            <line>anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to</line>
            <line>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
            <line>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,</line>
            <line>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times</line>
            <line>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose</line>
            <line>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather</line>
            <line>than lack it where there is such abundance.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
            <line>What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
            <line>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose</line>
            <line>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and</line>
            <line>finds no other advantage in the process but only the</line>
            <line>losing of hope by time.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
            <line>This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that</line>
            <line>'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was</line>
            <line>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so</line>
            <line>far, would have made nature immortal, and death</line>
            <line>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the</line>
            <line>king's sake, he were living! I think it would be</line>
            <line>the death of the king's disease.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
            <line>How called you the man you speak of, madam?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
            <line>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was</line>
            <line>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
            <line>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very</line>
            <line>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he</line>
            <line>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge</line>
            <line>could be set up against mortality.</line>

            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>I heard not of it before.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
            <line>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman</line>
            <line>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
            <line>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</line>
            <line>overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that</line>
            <line>her education promises; her dispositions she</line>
            <line>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where</line>
            <line>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</line>
            <line>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and</line>
            <line>traitors too; in her they are the better for their</line>
            <line>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
            <line>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
            <line>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise</line>
            <line>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches</line>
            <line>her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all</line>
            <line>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;</line>
            <line>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect</line>
            <line>a sorrow than have it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
            <line>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</line>
            <line>excessive grief the enemy to the living.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
            <line>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess</line>
            <line>makes it soon mortal.</line>

            <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
            <line>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</line>

            <line>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</line>
            <line>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue</line>
            <line>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</line>
            <line>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</line>
            <line>Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy</line>
            <line>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</line>
            <line>Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,</line>
            <line>But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,</line>
            <line>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,</line>
            <line>Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;</line>
            <line>'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>O, were that all! I think not on my father;</line>
            <line>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</line>
            <line>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</line>
            <line>I have forgot him: my imagination</line>
            <line>Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.</line>
            <line>I am undone: there is no living, none,</line>
            <line>If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one</line>
            <line>That I should love a bright particular star</line>
            <line>And think to wed it, he is so above me:</line>
            <line>In his bright radiance and collateral light</line>
            <line>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</line>
            <line>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</line>
            <line>The hind that would be mated by the lion</line>
            <line>Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,</line>
            <line>To see him every hour; to sit and draw</line>
            <line>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</line>
            <line>In our heart's table; heart too capable</line>
            <line>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</line>
            <line>But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy</line>
            <line>Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</line>
            <stagedir>Enter PAROLLES</stagedir>
            <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>
            <line>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;</line>
            <line>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</line>
            <line>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</line>
            <line>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,</line>
            <line>That they take place, when virtue's steely bones</line>
            <line>Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see</line>
            <line>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
            <line>Save you, fair queen!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>And you, monarch!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
            <line>Are you meditating on virginity?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</line>
            <line>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how</line>
            <line>may we barricado it against him?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
            <line>Keep him out.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,</line>
            <line>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</line>
            <line>warlike resistance.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
            <line>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</line>
            <line>undermine you and blow you up.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</line>
            <line>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</line>
            <line>virgins might blow up men?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
            <line>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</line>
            <line>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</line>
            <line>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</line>
            <line>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</line>
            <line>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</line>
            <line>increase and there was never virgin got till</line>
            <line>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</line>
            <line>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</line>
            <line>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is</line>
            <line>ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
            <line>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the</line>
            <line>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</line>
            <line>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</line>
            <line>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</line>
            <line>virginity murders itself and should be buried in</line>
            <line>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</line>
            <line>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</line>
            <line>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</line>
            <line>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</line>
            <line>Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</line>
            <line>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</line>
            <line>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</line>
            <line>by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make</line>
            <line>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</line>
            <line>principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
            <line>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it</line>
            <line>likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</line>
            <line>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't</line>
            <line>while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.</line>
            <line>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</line>
            <line>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</line>
            <line>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</line>
            <line>now. Your date is better in your pie and your</line>
            <line>porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,</line>
            <line>your old virginity, is like one of our French</line>
            <line>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,</line>
            <line>'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;</line>
            <line>marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Not my virginity yet</line>
            <line>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</line>
            <line>A mother and a mistress and a friend,</line>
            <line>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</line>
            <line>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</line>
            <line>A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</line>
            <line>His humble ambition, proud humility,</line>
            <line>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</line>
            <line>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</line>
            <line>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</line>
            <line>That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--</line>
            <line>I know not what he shall. God send him well!</line>
            <line>The court's a learning place, and he is one--</line>

            <line>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</line>

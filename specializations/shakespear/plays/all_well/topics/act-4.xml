         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.</line>
            <line>When you sally upon him, speak what terrible</line>
            <line>language you will: though you understand it not</line>
            <line>yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to</line>
            <line>understand him, unless some one among us whom we</line>
            <line>must produce for an interpreter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
            <line>Good captain, let me be the interpreter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?</line>

            <speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
            <line>No, sir, I warrant you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>He must think us some band of strangers i' the</line>
            <line>adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of</line>
            <line>all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every</line>
            <line>one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we</line>
            <line>speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to</line>
            <line>know straight our purpose: choughs' language,</line>
            <line>gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,</line>
            <line>interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,</line>
            <line>ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,</line>
            <line>and then to return and swear the lies he forges.</line>

            <speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
            <line>Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be</line>
            <line>time enough to go home. What shall I say I have</line>
            <line>done? It must be a very plausive invention that</line>
            <line>carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces</line>
            <line>have of late knocked too often at my door. I find</line>
            <line>my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the</line>
            <line>fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not</line>
            <line>daring the reports of my tongue.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue</line>

            <line>recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the</line>
            <line>impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I</line>
            <line>must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in</line>
            <line>exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they</line>
            <line>will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great</line>
            <line>ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the</line>
            <line>instance? Tongue, I must put you into a</line>
            <line>butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of</line>
            <line>Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.</line>

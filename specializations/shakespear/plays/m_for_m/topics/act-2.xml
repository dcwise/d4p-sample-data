            <line>We must not make a scarecrow of the law,</line>
            <line>Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,</line>
            <line>And let it keep one shape, till custom make it</line>
            <line>Their perch and not their terror.</line>

            <line>Ay, but yet</line>
            <line>Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,</line>
            <line>Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman</line>
            <line>Whom I would save, had a most noble father!</line>
            <line>Let but your honour know,</line>
            <line>Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,</line>
            <line>That, in the working of your own affections,</line>
            <line>Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,</line>
            <line>Or that the resolute acting of your blood</line>
            <line>Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,</line>
            <line>Whether you had not sometime in your life</line>
            <line>Err'd in this point which now you censure him,</line>
            <line>And pull'd the law upon you.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,</line>
            <line>Another thing to fall. I not deny,</line>
            <line>The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,</line>
            <line>May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two</line>
            <line>Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,</line>
            <line>That justice seizes: what know the laws</line>
            <line>That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,</line>
            <line>The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't</line>
            <line>Because we see it; but what we do not see</line>
            <line>We tread upon, and never think of it.</line>
            <line>You may not so extenuate his offence</line>
            <line>For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,</line>
            <line>When I, that censure him, do so offend,</line>
            <line>Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,</line>
            <line>And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.</line>

            <line>If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's</line>

            <line>If it? please your honour, I know not well what they</line>
            <line>are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure</line>
            <line>of; and void of all profanation in the world that</line>
            <line>good Christians ought to have.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ELBOW</speaker>
            <line>He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that</line>
            <line>serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they</line>
            <line>say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she</line>
            <line>professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.</line>

            <line>I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as</line>

            <line>Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she</line>

            <line>Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,</line>
            <line>saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;</line>
            <line>sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very</line>
            <line>distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a</line>
            <line>dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen</line>
            <line>such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very</line>
            <line>good dishes,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ESCALUS</speaker>
            <line>Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
            <line>No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in</line>
            <line>the right: but to the point. As I say, this</line>
            <line>Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and</line>
            <line>being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for</line>
            <line>prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,</line>
            <line>Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the</line>
            <line>rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very</line>
            <line>honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could</line>
            <line>not give you three-pence again.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FROTH</speaker>
            <line>No, indeed.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
            <line>Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>FROTH</speaker>
            <line>Ay, so I did indeed.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
            <line>Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be</line>
            <line>remembered, that such a one and such a one were past</line>
            <line>cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very</line>
            <line>good diet, as I told you,--</line>

            <speaker>ESCALUS</speaker>
            <line>Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What</line>
            <line>was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to</line>
            <line>complain of? Come me to what was done to her.</line>

            <line>Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's</line>

            <line>here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose</line>
            <line>father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FROTH</speaker>

            <line>And leave you to the hearing of the cause;</line>

            <line>I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,</line>
            <line>Let me entreat you speak the former language.</line>

            <line>My brother did love Juliet,</line>

            <line>Ha! little honour to be much believed,</line>
            <line>And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!</line>
            <line>I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:</line>
            <line>Sign me a present pardon for my brother,</line>
            <line>Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud</line>
            <line>What man thou art.</line>

            <line>Who will believe thee, Isabel?</line>
            <line>My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,</line>
            <line>My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,</line>
            <line>Will so your accusation overweigh,</line>
            <line>That you shall stifle in your own report</line>
            <line>And smell of calumny. I have begun,</line>
            <line>And now I give my sensual race the rein:</line>
            <line>Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;</line>
            <line>Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,</line>
            <line>That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother</line>
            <line>By yielding up thy body to my will;</line>
            <line>Or else he must not only die the death,</line>
            <line>But thy unkindness shall his death draw out</line>
            <line>To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,</line>
            <line>Or, by the affection that now guides me most,</line>
            <line>I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,</line>
            <line>Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.</line>

            <line>Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,</line>
            <line>That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,</line>
            <line>Either of condemnation or approof;</line>
            <line>Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:</line>
            <line>Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,</line>
            <line>To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:</line>
            <line>Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,</line>
            <line>Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.</line>
            <line>That, had he twenty heads to tender down</line>
            <line>On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,</line>

            <line>I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,</line>

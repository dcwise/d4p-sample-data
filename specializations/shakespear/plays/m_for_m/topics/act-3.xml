            <line>The miserable have no other medicine</line>
            <line>But only hope:</line>
            <line>I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.</line>

            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Be absolute for death; either death or life</line>
            <line>Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:</line>
            <line>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</line>
            <line>That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</line>
            <line>Servile to all the skyey influences,</line>
            <line>That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,</line>
            <line>Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;</line>
            <line>For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun</line>
            <line>And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;</line>
            <line>For all the accommodations that thou bear'st</line>
            <line>Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;</line>
            <line>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</line>
            <line>Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</line>
            <line>And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st</line>
            <line>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</line>
            <line>For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains</line>
            <line>That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;</line>
            <line>For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,</line>
            <line>And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;</line>
            <line>For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</line>
            <line>After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;</line>
            <line>For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</line>
            <line>Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,</line>
            <line>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;</line>
            <line>For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</line>
            <line>The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</line>
            <line>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</line>
            <line>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</line>
            <line>But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,</line>
            <line>Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth</line>
            <line>Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</line>
            <line>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</line>
            <line>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</line>
            <line>To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this</line>
            <line>That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</line>
            <line>Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,</line>
            <line>That makes these odds all even.</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Now, sister, what's the comfort?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Why,</line>
            <line>As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.</line>
            <line>Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,</line>
            <line>Intends you for his swift ambassador,</line>
            <line>Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:</line>
            <line>Therefore your best appointment make with speed;</line>
            <line>To-morrow you set on.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Is there no remedy?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>None, but such remedy as, to save a head,</line>
            <line>To cleave a heart in twain.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>But is there any?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Yes, brother, you may live:</line>
            <line>There is a devilish mercy in the judge,</line>
            <line>If you'll implore it, that will free your life,</line>
            <line>But fetter you till death.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Perpetual durance?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,</line>
            <line>Though all the world's vastidity you had,</line>
            <line>To a determined scope.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>But in what nature?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>In such a one as, you consenting to't,</line>
            <line>Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,</line>
            <line>And leave you naked.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Let me know the point.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,</line>
            <line>Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,</line>
            <line>And six or seven winters more respect</line>
            <line>Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?</line>
            <line>The sense of death is most in apprehension;</line>
            <line>And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,</line>
            <line>In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great</line>
            <line>As when a giant dies.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Why give you me this shame?</line>
            <line>Think you I can a resolution fetch</line>
            <line>From flowery tenderness? If I must die,</line>
            <line>I will encounter darkness as a bride,</line>
            <line>And hug it in mine arms.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>There spake my brother; there my father's grave</line>
            <line>Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:</line>
            <line>Thou art too noble to conserve a life</line>
            <line>In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,</line>
            <line>Whose settled visage and deliberate word</line>
            <line>Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew</line>
            <line>As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil</line>
            <line>His filth within being cast, he would appear</line>
            <line>A pond as deep as hell.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>The prenzie Angelo!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,</line>
            <line>The damned'st body to invest and cover</line>
            <line>In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?</line>
            <line>If I would yield him my virginity,</line>
            <line>Thou mightst be freed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>O heavens! it cannot be.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,</line>
            <line>So to offend him still. This night's the time</line>
            <line>That I should do what I abhor to name,</line>
            <line>Or else thou diest to-morrow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Thou shalt not do't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>O, were it but my life,</line>
            <line>I'ld throw it down for your deliverance</line>
            <line>As frankly as a pin.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Thanks, dear Isabel.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Yes. Has he affections in him,</line>
            <line>That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,</line>
            <line>When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,</line>
            <line>Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Which is the least?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>If it were damnable, he being so wise,</line>
            <line>Why would he for the momentary trick</line>
            <line>Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>What says my brother?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Death is a fearful thing.</line>

         <speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;</line>
            <line>To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;</line>
            <line>This sensible warm motion to become</line>
            <line>A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit</line>
            <line>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</line>
            <line>In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;</line>
            <line>To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,</line>
            <line>And blown with restless violence round about</line>
            <line>The pendent world; or to be worse than worst</line>
            <line>Of those that lawless and incertain thought</line>
            <line>Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!</line>
            <line>The weariest and most loathed worldly life</line>
            <line>That age, ache, penury and imprisonment</line>
            <line>Can lay on nature is a paradise</line>

            <line>Sweet sister, let me live:</line>
            <line>What sin you do to save a brother's life,</line>
            <line>Nature dispenses with the deed so far</line>

            <line>Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?</line>
            <line>Is't not a kind of incest, to take life</line>
            <line>From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?</line>
            <line>Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!</line>
            <line>For such a warped slip of wilderness</line>
            <line>Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!</line>
            <line>Die, perish! Might but my bending down</line>
            <line>Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:</line>

            <line>Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you</line>
            <line>and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to</line>
            <line>corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her</line>
            <line>virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition</line>
            <line>of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,</line>
            <line>hath made him that gracious denial which he is most</line>
            <line>glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I</line>
            <line>know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to</line>
            <line>death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes</line>
            <line>that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to</line>
            <line>your knees and make ready.</line>

            <line>The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:</line>
            <line>the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty</line>
            <line>brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of</line>
            <line>your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever</line>
            <line>fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,</line>
            <line>fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but</line>
            <line>that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should</line>
            <line>wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this</line>
            <line>substitute, and to save your brother?</line>

            <line>I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my</line>

            <line>unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke</line>
            <line>deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can</line>
            <line>speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or</line>

            <line>remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe</line>

            <line>lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from</line>

            <line>She should this Angelo have married; was affianced</line>

            <speaker>DUKE VINCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance</line>
            <line>of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that</line>
            <line>in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,</line>
            <line>like an impediment in the current, made it more</line>
            <line>violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his</line>
            <line>requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with</line>
            <line>his demands to the point; only refer yourself to</line>
            <line>this advantage, first, that your stay with him may</line>
            <line>not be long; that the time may have all shadow and</line>
            <line>silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.</line>
            <line>This being granted in course,--and now follows</line>
            <line>all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up</line>
            <line>your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter</line>
            <line>acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to</line>
            <line>her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother</line>
            <line>saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana</line>
            <line>advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid</line>
            <line>will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you</line>
            <line>think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness</line>

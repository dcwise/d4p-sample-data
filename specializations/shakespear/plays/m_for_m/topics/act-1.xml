            <line>Angelo,</line>
            <line>There is a kind of character in thy life,</line>
            <line>That to the observer doth thy history</line>
            <line>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</line>
            <line>Are not thine own so proper as to waste</line>
            <line>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</line>
            <line>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</line>
            <line>Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</line>
            <line>Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike</line>
            <line>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd</line>
            <line>But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends</line>
            <line>The smallest scruple of her excellence</line>
            <line>But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</line>
            <line>Herself the glory of a creditor,</line>
            <line>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</line>
            <line>To one that can my part in him advertise;</line>
            <line>Hold therefore, Angelo:--</line>
            <line>In our remove be thou at full ourself;</line>
            <line>Mortality and mercy in Vienna</line>
            <line>Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,</line>
            <line>Though first in question, is thy secondary.</line>
            <line>Take thy commission.</line>

            <line>Now, good my lord,</line>
            <line>Let there be some more test made of my metal,</line>

            <line>Our haste from hence is of so quick condition</line>
            <line>That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd</line>
            <line>Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,</line>
            <line>As time and our concernings shall importune,</line>
            <line>How it goes with us, and do look to know</line>
            <line>What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;</line>

            <line>Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do</line>
            <line>With any scruple; your scope is as mine own</line>
            <line>So to enforce or qualify the laws</line>
            <line>As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:</line>
            <line>I'll privily away. I love the people,</line>
            <line>But do not like to stage me to their eyes:</line>
            <line>Through it do well, I do not relish well</line>
            <line>Their loud applause and Aves vehement;</line>
            <line>Nor do I think the man of safe discretion</line>
            <line>That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</line>

            <line>For that which, if myself might be his judge,</line>
            <line>He should receive his punishment in thanks:</line>
            <line>He hath got his friend with child.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Sir, make me not your story.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>It is true.</line>
            <line>I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin</line>
            <line>With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,</line>
            <line>Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:</line>
            <line>I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.</line>
            <line>By your renouncement an immortal spirit,</line>
            <line>And to be talk'd with in sincerity,</line>
            <line>As with a saint.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:</line>
            <line>Your brother and his lover have embraced:</line>
            <line>As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time</line>
            <line>That from the seedness the bare fallow brings</line>
            <line>To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb</line>
            <line>Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>Is she your cousin?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names</line>
            <line>By vain though apt affection.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>She it is.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>O, let him marry her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>This is the point.</line>
            <line>The duke is very strangely gone from hence;</line>
            <line>Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,</line>
            <line>In hand and hope of action: but we do learn</line>
            <line>By those that know the very nerves of state,</line>
            <line>His givings-out were of an infinite distance</line>
            <line>From his true-meant design. Upon his place,</line>
            <line>And with full line of his authority,</line>
            <line>Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood</line>
            <line>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels</line>
            <line>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,</line>
            <line>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</line>
            <line>With profits of the mind, study and fast.</line>
            <line>He--to give fear to use and liberty,</line>
            <line>Which have for long run by the hideous law,</line>
            <line>As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,</line>
            <line>Under whose heavy sense your brother's life</line>
            <line>Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;</line>
            <line>And follows close the rigour of the statute,</line>
            <line>To make him an example. All hope is gone,</line>
            <line>Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer</line>
            <line>To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business</line>
            <line>'Twixt you and your poor brother.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Doth he so seek his life?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>Has censured him</line>
            <line>Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath</line>
            <line>A warrant for his execution.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Alas! what poor ability's in me</line>
            <line>To do him good?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>Assay the power you have.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>My power? Alas, I doubt--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>Our doubts are traitors</line>
            <line>And make us lose the good we oft might win</line>
            <line>By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,</line>
            <line>And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,</line>
            <line>Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,</line>
            <line>All their petitions are as freely theirs</line>
            <line>As they themselves would owe them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>I'll see what I can do.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>But speedily.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>I will about it straight;</line>
            <line>No longer staying but to give the mother</line>
            <line>Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:</line>
            <line>Commend me to my brother: soon at night</line>
            <line>I'll send him certain word of my success.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIO</speaker>
            <line>I take my leave of you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ISABELLA</speaker>
            <line>Good sir, adieu.</line>

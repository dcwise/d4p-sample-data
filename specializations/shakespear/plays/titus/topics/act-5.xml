            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,</line>
            <line>I have received letters from great Rome,</line>
            <line>Which signify what hate they bear their emperor</line>
            <line>And how desirous of our sight they are.</line>
            <line>Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,</line>
            <line>Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,</line>
            <line>And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,</line>
            <line>Let him make treble satisfaction.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Goth</speaker>
            <line>Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,</line>
            <line>Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;</line>
            <line>Whose high exploits and honourable deeds</line>
            <line>Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,</line>
            <line>Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,</line>
            <line>Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day</line>
            <line>Led by their master to the flowered fields,</line>
            <line>And be avenged on cursed Tamora.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>All the Goths</speaker>
            <line>And as he saith, so say we all with him.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.</line>
            <line>But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Goth</speaker>
            <line>Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd</line>
            <line>To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;</line>
            <line>And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye</line>
            <line>Upon the wasted building, suddenly</line>
            <line>I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</line>
            <line>I made unto the noise; when soon I heard</line>
            <line>The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:</line>
            <line>'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!</line>
            <line>Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</line>
            <line>Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,</line>
            <line>Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:</line>
            <line>But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</line>
            <line>They never do beget a coal-black calf.</line>
            <line>Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates</line>
            <line>the babe,--</line>
            <line>'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;</line>
            <line>Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,</line>
            <line>Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'</line>
            <line>With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,</line>
            <line>Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,</line>
            <line>To use as you think needful of the man.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</line>
            <line>That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;</line>
            <line>This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,</line>
            <line>And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.</line>
            <line>Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey</line>
            <line>This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</line>
            <line>Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?</line>
            <line>A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.</line>
            <line>And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Too like the sire for ever being good.</line>
            <line>First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;</line>
            <line>A sight to vex the father's soul withal.</line>
            <line>Get me a ladder.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Lucius, save the child,</line>
            <line>And bear it from me to the empress.</line>
            <line>If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,</line>
            <line>That highly may advantage thee to hear:</line>
            <line>If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</line>
            <line>I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st</line>
            <line>Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,</line>
            <line>'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;</line>
            <line>For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,</line>
            <line>Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</line>
            <line>Complots of mischief, treason, villanies</line>
            <line>Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:</line>
            <line>And this shall all be buried by my death,</line>
            <line>Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:</line>
            <line>That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;</line>
            <line>Yet, for I know thou art religious</line>
            <line>And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</line>
            <line>With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,</line>
            <line>Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</line>
            <line>Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know</line>
            <line>An idiot holds his bauble for a god</line>
            <line>And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</line>
            <line>To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow</line>
            <line>By that same god, what god soe'er it be,</line>
            <line>That thou adorest and hast in reverence,</line>
            <line>To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;</line>
            <line>Or else I will discover nought to thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>First know thou, I begot him on the empress.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</line>
            <line>To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</line>
            <line>'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;</line>
            <line>They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her</line>
            <line>And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas</line>
            <line>Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:</line>
            <line>That codding spirit had they from their mother,</line>
            <line>As sure a card as ever won the set;</line>
            <line>That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,</line>
            <line>As true a dog as ever fought at head.</line>
            <line>Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</line>
            <line>I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole</line>
            <line>Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:</line>
            <line>I wrote the letter that thy father found</line>
            <line>And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,</line>
            <line>Confederate with the queen and her two sons:</line>
            <line>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</line>
            <line>Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</line>
            <line>I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,</line>
            <line>And, when I had it, drew myself apart</line>
            <line>And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:</line>
            <line>I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall</line>
            <line>When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;</line>
            <line>Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,</line>
            <line>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :</line>
            <line>And when I told the empress of this sport,</line>
            <line>She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,</line>
            <line>And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Goth</speaker>
            <line>What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</line>
            <line>Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,</line>
            <line>Few come within the compass of my curse,--</line>
            <line>Wherein I did not some notorious ill,</line>
            <line>As kill a man, or else devise his death,</line>
            <line>Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</line>
            <line>Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,</line>
            <line>Set deadly enmity between two friends,</line>
            <line>Make poor men's cattle break their necks;</line>
            <line>Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,</line>
            <line>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</line>
            <line>Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,</line>
            <line>And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,</line>
            <line>Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;</line>
            <line>And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</line>
            <line>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</line>
            <line>'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'</line>
            <line>Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things</line>
            <line>As willingly as one would kill a fly,</line>
            <line>And nothing grieves me heartily indeed</line>
            <line>But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Bring down the devil; for he must not die</line>

            <line>So I might have your company in hell,</line>
            <line>But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</line>

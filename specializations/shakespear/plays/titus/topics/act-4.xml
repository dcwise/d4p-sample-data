         <stagedir>Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him,

            <line>Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia</line>
            <line>Follows me every where, I know not why:</line>
            <line>Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.</line>
            <line>Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.</line>

            <line>Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.</line>

            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:</line>
            <line>See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:</line>
            <line>Somewhither would she have thee go with her.</line>
            <line>Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care</line>
            <line>Read to her sons than she hath read to thee</line>
            <line>Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.</line>

            <speaker>Young LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,</line>
            <line>Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:</line>
            <line>For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,</line>
            <line>Extremity of griefs would make men mad;</line>
            <line>And I have read that Hecuba of Troy</line>
            <line>Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;</line>
            <line>Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt</line>
            <line>Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,</line>
            <line>And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:</line>
            <line>Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--</line>
            <line>Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:</line>
            <line>And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,</line>
            <line>I will most willingly attend your ladyship.</line>

            <line>How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?</line>
            <line>Some book there is that she desires to see.</line>
            <line>Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.</line>
            <line>But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd</line>
            <line>Come, and take choice of all my library,</line>
            <line>And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens</line>
            <line>Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.</line>
            <line>Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>I think she means that there was more than one</line>
            <line>Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;</line>
            <line>Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Young LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;</line>
            <line>My mother gave it me.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>For love of her that's gone,</line>
            <line>Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!</line>
            <stagedir>Helping her</stagedir>
            <line>What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?</line>
            <line>This is the tragic tale of Philomel,</line>
            <line>And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:</line>
            <line>And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.</line>

         <speech>

            <line>Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,</line>
            <line>Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,</line>
            <line>Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!</line>
            <line>Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--</line>
            <line>O, had we never, never hunted there!--</line>
            <line>Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,</line>
            <line>By nature made for murders and for rapes.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>O, why should nature build so foul a den,</line>

            <line>What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:</line>
            <line>Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,</line>
            <line>That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?</line>

            <line>Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.</line>
            <line>Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,</line>
            <line>Inspire me, that I may this treason find!</line>
            <line>My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:</line>
            <line>This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst</line>
            <line>This after me, when I have writ my name</line>
            <line>Without the help of any hand at all.</line>
            <stagedir>He writes his name with his staff, and guides it
with feet and mouth</stagedir>
            <line>Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!</line>
            <line>Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,</line>
            <line>What God will have discover'd for revenge;</line>
            <line>Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,</line>
            <line>That we may know the traitors and the truth!</line>

            <line>O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know</line>
            <line>There is enough written upon this earth</line>
            <line>To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts</line>
            <line>And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.</line>
            <line>My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;</line>
            <line>And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;</line>
            <line>And swear with me, as, with the woful fere</line>

            <line>Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,</line>

            <line>'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.</line>
            <line>But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:</line>
            <line>The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,</line>
            <line>She's with the lion deeply still in league,</line>
            <line>And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,</line>

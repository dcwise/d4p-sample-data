      <scene-body>
         <stagedir>Enter Judges, Senators and Tribunes, with MARTIUS
and QUINTUS, bound, passing on to the place of
execution; TITUS going before, pleading</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!</line>
            <line>For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent</line>
            <line>In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;</line>
            <line>For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;</line>
            <line>For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;</line>
            <line>And for these bitter tears, which now you see</line>
            <line>Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;</line>
            <line>Be pitiful to my condemned sons,</line>
            <line>Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.</line>
            <line>For two and twenty sons I never wept,</line>
            <line>Because they died in honour's lofty bed.</line>
            <stagedir>Lieth down; the Judges, &amp;c., pass by him, and Exeunt</stagedir>
            <line>For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write</line>
            <line>My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:</line>
            <line>Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;</line>
            <line>My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.</line>
            <line>O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,</line>
            <line>That shall distil from these two ancient urns,</line>
            <line>Than youthful April shall with all his showers:</line>
            <line>In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;</line>
            <line>In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow</line>
            <line>And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,</line>
            <line>So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn</stagedir>
            <line>O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!</line>
            <line>Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;</line>
            <line>And let me say, that never wept before,</line>
            <line>My tears are now prevailing orators.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>O noble father, you lament in vain:</line>
            <line>The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;</line>
            <line>And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.</line>
            <line>Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,</line>
            <line>They would not mark me, or if they did mark,</line>
            <line>They would not pity me, yet plead I must;</line>
            <line>And bootless unto them.</line>
            <line>Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;</line>
            <line>Who, though they cannot answer my distress,</line>
            <line>Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,</line>
            <line>For that they will not intercept my tale:</line>
            <line>When I do weep, they humbly at my feet</line>
            <line>Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;</line>
            <line>And, were they but attired in grave weeds,</line>
            <line>Rome could afford no tribune like to these.</line>
            <line>A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;</line>
            <line>A stone is silent, and offendeth not,</line>
            <line>And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</line>
            <stagedir>Rises</stagedir>
            <line>But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>To rescue my two brothers from their death:</line>
            <line>For which attempt the judges have pronounced</line>
            <line>My everlasting doom of banishment.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>O happy man! they have befriended thee.</line>
            <line>Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive</line>
            <line>That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?</line>
            <line>Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey</line>
            <line>But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,</line>
            <line>From these devourers to be banished!</line>
            <line>But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;</line>
            <line>Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:</line>
            <line>I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Will it consume me? let me see it, then.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>This was thy daughter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Why, Marcus, so she is.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Ay me, this object kills me!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.</line>
            <line>Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand</line>
            <line>Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?</line>
            <line>What fool hath added water to the sea,</line>
            <line>Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?</line>
            <line>My grief was at the height before thou camest,</line>
            <line>And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.</line>
            <line>Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;</line>
            <line>For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;</line>
            <line>And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;</line>
            <line>In bootless prayer have they been held up,</line>
            <line>And they have served me to effectless use:</line>
            <line>Now all the service I require of them</line>
            <line>Is that the one will help to cut the other.</line>
            <line>'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;</line>
            <line>For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>O, that delightful engine of her thoughts</line>
            <line>That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,</line>
            <line>Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,</line>
            <line>Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung</line>
            <line>Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>O, thus I found her, straying in the park,</line>
            <line>Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer</line>
            <line>That hath received some unrecuring wound.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>It was my deer; and he that wounded her</line>
            <line>Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:</line>
            <line>For now I stand as one upon a rock</line>
            <line>Environed with a wilderness of sea,</line>
            <line>Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,</line>
            <line>Expecting ever when some envious surge</line>
            <line>Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.</line>
            <line>This way to death my wretched sons are gone;</line>
            <line>Here stands my other son, a banished man,</line>
            <line>And here my brother, weeping at my woes.</line>
            <line>But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,</line>
            <line>Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.</line>
            <line>Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,</line>
            <line>It would have madded me: what shall I do</line>
            <line>Now I behold thy lively body so?</line>
            <line>Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:</line>
            <line>Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:</line>
            <line>Thy husband he is dead: and for his death</line>
            <line>Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.</line>
            <line>Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!</line>
            <line>When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears</line>
            <line>Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew</line>
            <line>Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;</line>
            <line>Perchance because she knows them innocent.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful</line>
            <line>Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.</line>
            <line>No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;</line>
            <line>Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.</line>
            <line>Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.</line>
            <line>Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:</line>
            <line>Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,</line>
            <line>And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,</line>
            <line>Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks</line>
            <line>How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,</line>
            <line>With miry slime left on them by a flood?</line>
            <line>And in the fountain shall we gaze so long</line>
            <line>Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,</line>
            <line>And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?</line>
            <line>Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?</line>
            <line>Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows</line>
            <line>Pass the remainder of our hateful days?</line>
            <line>What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,</line>
            <line>Plot some deuce of further misery,</line>
            <line>To make us wonder'd at in time to come.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,</line>
            <line>See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot</line>
            <line>Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,</line>
            <line>For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
            <line>Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:</line>
            <line>Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say</line>
            <line>That to her brother which I said to thee:</line>
            <line>His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,</line>
            <line>Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.</line>
            <line>O, what a sympathy of woe is this,</line>
            <line>As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter AARON</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor</line>
            <line>Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,</line>
            <line>Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,</line>
            <line>Or any one of you, chop off your hand,</line>
            <line>And send it to the king: he for the same</line>
            <line>Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;</line>
            <line>And that shall be the ransom for their fault.</line>

            <line>O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!</line>

            <line>That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?</line>
            <line>With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,</line>
            <line>That hath thrown down so many enemies,</line>
            <line>Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:</line>
            <line>My youth can better spare my blood than you;</line>
            <line>And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.</line>

            <line>Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,</line>

            <line>Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?</line>
            <line>O, none of both but are of high desert:</line>
            <line>My hand hath been but idle; let it serve</line>
            <line>To ransom my two nephews from their death;</line>
            <line>Then have I kept it to a worthy end.</line>

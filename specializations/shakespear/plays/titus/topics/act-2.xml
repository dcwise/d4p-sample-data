            <line>Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,</line>
            <line>Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,</line>
            <line>Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;</line>
            <line>Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.</line>
            <line>As when the golden sun salutes the morn,</line>
            <line>And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,</line>
            <line>Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,</line>
            <line>And overlooks the highest-peering hills;</line>
            <line>So Tamora:</line>
            <line>Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,</line>
            <line>And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.</line>
            <line>Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,</line>
            <line>To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,</line>
            <line>And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long</line>
            <line>Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains</line>
            <line>And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes</line>
            <line>Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.</line>
            <line>Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!</line>
            <line>I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,</line>
            <line>To wait upon this new-made empress.</line>
            <line>To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,</line>
            <line>This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,</line>
            <line>This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,</line>
            <line>And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.</line>

            <line>Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,</line>

            <line>'Tis not the difference of a year or two</line>
            <line>Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:</line>
            <line>I am as able and as fit as thou</line>
            <line>To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;</line>
            <line>And that my sword upon thee shall approve,</line>
            <line>And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.</line>

            <line>Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,</line>
            <line>Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,</line>
            <line>Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?</line>
            <line>Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath</line>
            <line>Till you know better how to handle it.</line>

            <speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
            <line>Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,</line>

               <stagedir>Coming forward</stagedir>  Why, how now, lords!</line>
            <line>So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,</line>
            <line>And maintain such a quarrel openly?</line>
            <line>Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:</line>
            <line>I would not for a million of gold</line>
            <line>The cause were known to them it most concerns;</line>
            <line>Nor would your noble mother for much more</line>
            <line>Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.</line>
            <line>For shame, put up.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
            <line>Not I, till I have sheathed</line>
            <line>My rapier in his bosom and withal</line>
            <line>Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat</line>
            <line>That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
            <line>For that I am prepared and full resolved.</line>
            <line>Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,</line>
            <line>And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!</line>

            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Away, I say!</line>
            <line>Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,</line>
            <line>This petty brabble will undo us all.</line>
            <line>Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous</line>
            <line>It is to jet upon a prince's right?</line>
            <line>What, is Lavinia then become so loose,</line>
            <line>Or Bassianus so degenerate,</line>
            <line>That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd</line>
            <line>Without controlment, justice, or revenge?</line>
            <line>Young lords, beware! and should the empress know</line>
            <line>This discord's ground, the music would not please.</line>

            <line>I care not, I, knew she and all the world:</line>
            <line>I love Lavinia more than all the world.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
            <line>Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:</line>
            <line>Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome</line>
            <line>How furious and impatient they be,</line>
            <line>And cannot brook competitors in love?</line>
            <line>I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths</line>
            <line>By this device.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
            <line>Aaron, a thousand deaths</line>
            <line>Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>To achieve her! how?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
            <line>Why makest thou it so strange?</line>
            <line>She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;</line>
            <line>She is a woman, therefore may be won;</line>
            <line>She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.</line>
            <line>What, man! more water glideth by the mill</line>
            <line>Than wots the miller of; and easy it is</line>
            <line>Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:</line>
            <line>Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.</line>
            <line>Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.</line>

            <line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
            <line>Then why should he despair that knows to court it</line>
            <line>With words, fair looks and liberality?</line>
            <line>What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,</line>
            <line>And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so</line>
            <line>Would serve your turns.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
            <line>Ay, so the turn were served.</line>

            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>Would you had hit it too!</line>
            <line>Then should not we be tired with this ado.</line>
            <line>Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools</line>
            <line>To square for this? would it offend you, then</line>
            <line>That both should speed?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHIRON</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>AARON</speaker>
            <line>For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:</line>
            <line>'Tis policy and stratagem must do</line>
            <line>That you affect; and so must you resolve,</line>
            <line>That what you cannot as you would achieve,</line>
            <line>You must perforce accomplish as you may.</line>
            <line>Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste</line>
            <line>Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.</line>
            <line>A speedier course than lingering languishment</line>
            <line>Must we pursue, and I have found the path.</line>
            <line>My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;</line>
            <line>There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:</line>
            <line>The forest walks are wide and spacious;</line>
            <line>And many unfrequented plots there are</line>
            <line>Fitted by kind for rape and villany:</line>
            <line>Single you thither then this dainty doe,</line>
            <line>And strike her home by force, if not by words:</line>
            <line>This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.</line>
            <line>Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit</line>
            <line>To villany and vengeance consecrate,</line>
            <line>Will we acquaint with all that we intend;</line>
            <line>And she shall file our engines with advice,</line>
            <line>That will not suffer you to square yourselves,</line>
            <line>But to your wishes' height advance you both.</line>
            <line>The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,</line>
            <line>The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:</line>
            <line>The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;</line>
            <line>There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take</line>
            <line>your turns;</line>
            <line>There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,</line>
            <line>And revel in Lavinia's treasury.</line>

            <speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
            <line>Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,</line>

            <line>Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,</line>

            <line>Thy sons make pillage of her chastity</line>

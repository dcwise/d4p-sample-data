      <scene-body>
         <stagedir>Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum
and colours</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>YORK</speaker>
            <line>From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,</line>
            <line>And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:</line>
            <line>Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,</line>
            <line>To entertain great England's lawful king.</line>
            <line>Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?</line>
            <line>Let them obey that know not how to rule;</line>
            <line>This hand was made to handle naught but gold.</line>
            <line>I cannot give due action to my words,</line>
            <line>Except a sword or sceptre balance it:</line>
            <line>A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,</line>
            <line>On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter BUCKINGHAM</stagedir>
            <line>Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?</line>
            <line>The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>YORK</speaker>
            <line>Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.</line>
            <line>Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,</line>
            <line>To know the reason of these arms in peace;</line>
            <line>Or why thou, being a subject as I am,</line>
            <line>Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,</line>
            <line>Should raise so great a power without his leave,</line>
            <line>Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>YORK</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:</line>
            <line>O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,</line>
            <line>I am so angry at these abject terms;</line>
            <line>And now, like Ajax Telamonius,</line>
            <line>On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.</line>
            <line>I am far better born than is the king,</line>
            <line>More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:</line>
            <line>But I must make fair weather yet a while,</line>
            <line>Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--</line>
            <line>Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,</line>
            <line>That I have given no answer all this while;</line>
            <line>My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.</line>
            <line>The cause why I have brought this army hither</line>
            <line>Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,</line>
            <line>Seditious to his grace and to the state.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>That is too much presumption on thy part:</line>
            <line>But if thy arms be to no other end,</line>
            <line>The king hath yielded unto thy demand:</line>
            <line>The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>YORK</speaker>
            <line>Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>YORK</speaker>
            <line>Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.</line>
            <line>Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;</line>
            <line>Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,</line>
            <line>You shall have pay and every thing you wish.</line>
            <line>And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,</line>
            <line>Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,</line>
            <line>As pledges of my fealty and love;</line>
            <line>I'll send them all as willing as I live:</line>
            <line>Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,</line>
            <line>Is his to use, so Somerset may die.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>York, I commend this kind submission:</line>
            <line>We twain will go into his highness' tent.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,</line>
            <line>That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>YORK</speaker>
            <line>In all submission and humility</line>
            <line>York doth present himself unto your highness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>YORK</speaker>
            <line>To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,</line>
            <line>And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,</line>
            <line>Who since I heard to be discomfited.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IDEN</speaker>
            <line>If one so rude and of so mean condition</line>
            <line>May pass into the presence of a king,</line>
            <line>Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,</line>
            <line>The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!</line>
            <line>O, let me view his visage, being dead,</line>
            <line>That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.</line>
            <line>Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IDEN</speaker>
            <line>I was, an't like your majesty.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IDEN</speaker>
            <line>Alexander Iden, that's my name;</line>
            <line>A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:</line>
            <line>Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
            <line>For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,</line>
            <line>But boldly stand and front him to his face.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>YORK</speaker>
            <line>How now! is Somerset at liberty?</line>
            <line>Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,</line>
            <line>And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.</line>
            <line>Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?</line>
            <line>False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,</line>
            <line>Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?</line>
            <line>King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,</line>
            <line>Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,</line>
            <line>Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.</line>
            <line>That head of thine doth not become a crown;</line>
            <line>Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,</line>
            <line>And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.</line>
            <line>That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,</line>
            <line>Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,</line>
            <line>Is able with the change to kill and cure.</line>
            <line>Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up</line>
            <line>And with the same to act controlling laws.</line>
            <line>Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more</line>
            <line>O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.</line>

            <line>Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;</line>

            <line>The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,</line>
            <line>Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those</line>

            <line>This is my king, York, I do not mistake;</line>
            <line>But thou mistakest me much to think I do:</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour</line>

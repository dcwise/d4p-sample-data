            <line>Did he so often lodge in open field,</line>
            <line>In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,</line>
            <line>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</line>

            <line>I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?</line>
            <line>'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.</line>
            <line>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage</line>

            <line>Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands</line>
            <line>And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,</line>
            <line>While all is shared and all is borne away,</line>
            <line>Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:</line>
            <line>So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,</line>
            <line>While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.</line>
            <line>Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland</line>
            <line>Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood</line>
            <line>As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd</line>

            <line>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</line>
            <line>Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,</line>
            <line>Even as I have of fertile England's soil.</line>
            <line>A day will come when York shall claim his own;</line>
            <line>And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts</line>
            <line>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,</line>
            <line>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,</line>
            <line>For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:</line>
            <line>Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,</line>
            <line>Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,</line>
            <line>Nor wear the diadem upon his head,</line>
            <line>Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.</line>
            <line>Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:</line>
            <line>Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,</line>
            <line>To pry into the secrets of the state;</line>
            <line>Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,</line>
            <line>With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,</line>
            <line>And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:</line>
            <line>Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</line>
            <line>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;</line>
            <line>And in my standard bear the arms of York</line>
            <line>To grapple with the house of Lancaster;</line>
            <line>And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,</line>
            <line>Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.</line>

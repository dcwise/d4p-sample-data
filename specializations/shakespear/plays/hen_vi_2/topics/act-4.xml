         <stagedir>Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a

            <speaker>Captain</speaker>
            <line>The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day</line>
            <line>Is crept into the bosom of the sea;</line>
            <line>And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades</line>
            <line>That drag the tragic melancholy night;</line>
            <line>Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,</line>
            <line>Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws</line>
            <line>Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.</line>
            <line>Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;</line>
            <line>For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,</line>
            <line>Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,</line>
            <line>Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.</line>
            <line>Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;</line>
            <line>And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;</line>
            <line>The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>What is my ransom, master? let me know.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Master</speaker>
            <line>A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Master's-Mate</speaker>
            <line>And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Captain</speaker>
            <line>What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,</line>
            <line>And bear the name and port of gentlemen?</line>
            <line>Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:</line>
            <line>The lives of those which we have lost in fight</line>
            <line>Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>And so will I and write home for it straight.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WHITMORE</speaker>
            <line>I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,</line>
            <line>And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;</line>
            <stagedir>To SUFFOLK</stagedir>
            <line>And so should these, if I might have my will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Captain</speaker>
            <line>Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Look on my George; I am a gentleman:</line>
            <line>Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WHITMORE</speaker>
            <line>And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.</line>
            <line>How now! why start'st thou? what, doth</line>
            <line>death affright?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.</line>
            <line>A cunning man did calculate my birth</line>
            <line>And told me that by water I should die:</line>
            <line>Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;</line>
            <line>Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WHITMORE</speaker>
            <line>Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:</line>
            <line>Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,</line>
            <line>But with our sword we wiped away the blot;</line>
            <line>Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,</line>
            <line>Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,</line>
            <line>And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,</line>
            <line>The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WHITMORE</speaker>
            <line>The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:</line>
            <line>Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Captain</speaker>
            <line>But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,</line>
            <line>The honourable blood of Lancaster,</line>
            <line>Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.</line>
            <line>Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?</line>
            <line>Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule</line>
            <line>And thought thee happy when I shook my head?</line>
            <line>How often hast thou waited at my cup,</line>
            <line>Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.</line>
            <line>When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?</line>
            <line>Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,</line>
            <line>Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;</line>
            <line>How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood</line>
            <line>And duly waited for my coming forth?</line>
            <line>This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,</line>
            <line>And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WHITMORE</speaker>
            <line>Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Captain</speaker>
            <line>First let my words stab him, as he hath me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Captain</speaker>
            <line>Convey him hence and on our longboat's side</line>
            <line>Strike off his head.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>

            <speaker>Captain</speaker>
            <line>Pool! Sir Pool! lord!</line>
            <line>Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt</line>
            <line>Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.</line>
            <line>Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth</line>
            <line>For swallowing the treasure of the realm:</line>
            <line>Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;</line>
            <line>And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,</line>
            <line>Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,</line>
            <line>Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:</line>
            <line>And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,</line>
            <line>For daring to affy a mighty lord</line>
            <line>Unto the daughter of a worthless king,</line>
            <line>Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.</line>
            <line>By devilish policy art thou grown great,</line>
            <line>And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged</line>
            <line>With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.</line>
            <line>By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,</line>
            <line>The false revolting Normans thorough thee</line>
            <line>Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy</line>
            <line>Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,</line>
            <line>And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.</line>
            <line>The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,</line>
            <line>Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,</line>
            <line>As hating thee, are rising up in arms:</line>
            <line>And now the house of York, thrust from the crown</line>
            <line>By shameful murder of a guiltless king</line>
            <line>And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,</line>
            <line>Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours</line>
            <line>Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,</line>
            <line>Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'</line>
            <line>The commons here in Kent are up in arms:</line>
            <line>And, to conclude, reproach and beggary</line>
            <line>Is crept into the palace of our king.</line>
            <line>And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder</line>
            <line>Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!</line>
            <line>Small things make base men proud: this villain here,</line>
            <line>Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more</line>
            <line>Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.</line>
            <line>Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:</line>
            <line>It is impossible that I should die</line>
            <line>By such a lowly vassal as thyself.</line>
            <line>Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:</line>
            <line>I go of message from the queen to France;</line>
            <line>I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.</line>

            <line>Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,</line>
            <line>Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.</line>
            <line>Far be it we should honour such as these</line>
            <line>With humble suit: no, rather let my head</line>
            <line>Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any</line>
            <line>Save to the God of heaven and to my king;</line>
            <line>And sooner dance upon a bloody pole</line>

            <line>Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,</line>
            <line>That this my death may never be forgot!</line>
            <line>Great men oft die by vile bezonians:</line>
            <line>A Roman sworder and banditto slave</line>
            <line>Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand</line>
            <line>Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders</line>
            <line>Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.</line>

            <speaker>Captain</speaker>

            <line>His body will I bear unto the king:</line>

            <line>hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a</line>
            <line>thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,</line>
            <line>on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to</line>
            <line>see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another</line>
            <line>while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach</line>
            <line>this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'</line>
            <line>was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a</line>
            <line>sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown</line>
            <line>bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and</line>
            <line>bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a</line>
            <line>quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'</line>
            <line>must serve me to feed on.</line>

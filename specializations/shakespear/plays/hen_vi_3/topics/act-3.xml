         <stagedir>Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands</stagedir>

            <speaker>First Keeper</speaker>
            <line>Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;</line>
            <line>For through this laund anon the deer will come;</line>
            <line>And in this covert will we make our stand,</line>
            <line>Culling the principal of all the deer.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Keeper</speaker>
            <line>I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Keeper</speaker>
            <line>That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow</line>
            <line>Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.</line>
            <line>Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:</line>
            <line>And, for the time shall not seem tedious,</line>
            <line>I'll tell thee what befell me on a day</line>
            <line>In this self-place where now we mean to stand.</line>

            <speaker>Second Keeper</speaker>
            <line>Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.</line>

            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,</line>
            <line>To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.</line>
            <line>No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;</line>
            <line>Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,</line>
            <line>Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:</line>
            <line>No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,</line>
            <line>No humble suitors press to speak for right,</line>
            <line>No, not a man comes for redress of thee;</line>
            <line>For how can I help them, and not myself?</line>

            <line>Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:</line>
            <line>This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.</line>

            <line>Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Keeper</speaker>
            <line>Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>My queen and son are gone to France for aid;</line>
            <line>And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick</line>
            <line>Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister</line>
            <line>To wife for Edward: if this news be true,</line>
            <line>Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;</line>
            <line>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</line>
            <line>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</line>
            <line>By this account then Margaret may win him;</line>
            <line>For she's a woman to be pitied much:</line>
            <line>Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;</line>
            <line>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</line>
            <line>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</line>
            <line>And Nero will be tainted with remorse,</line>
            <line>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</line>
            <line>Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;</line>
            <line>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,</line>
            <line>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</line>
            <line>She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;</line>
            <line>He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;</line>
            <line>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</line>
            <line>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</line>
            <line>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</line>
            <line>And in conclusion wins the king from her,</line>
            <line>With promise of his sister, and what else,</line>
            <line>To strengthen and support King Edward's place.</line>
            <line>O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,</line>
            <line>Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Keeper</speaker>
            <line>Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>More than I seem, and less than I was born to:</line>
            <line>A man at least, for less I should not be;</line>
            <line>And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Keeper</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Keeper</speaker>
            <line>But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</line>
            <line>Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,</line>
            <line>Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:</line>
            <line>A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Keeper</speaker>
            <line>Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,</line>
            <line>Your crown content and you must be contented</line>
            <line>To go along with us; for as we think,</line>
            <line>You are the king King Edward hath deposed;</line>
            <line>And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance</line>
            <line>Will apprehend you as his enemy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>But did you never swear, and break an oath?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Keeper</speaker>
            <line>No, never such an oath; nor will not now.</line>

            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Where did you dwell when I was King of England?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Keeper</speaker>
            <line>Here in this country, where we now remain.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>I was anointed king at nine months old;</line>
            <line>My father and my grandfather were kings,</line>
            <line>And you were sworn true subjects unto me:</line>
            <line>And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Keeper</speaker>
            <line>No;</line>
            <line>For we were subjects but while you were king.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?</line>
            <line>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</line>
            <line>Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</line>
            <line>And as the air blows it to me again,</line>
            <line>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</line>
            <line>And yielding to another when it blows,</line>
            <line>Commanded always by the greater gust;</line>
            <line>Such is the lightness of you common men.</line>
            <line>But do not break your oaths; for of that sin</line>
            <line>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</line>
            <line>Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;</line>
            <line>And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Keeper</speaker>
            <line>We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>So would you be again to Henry,</line>

            <speaker>First Keeper</speaker>
            <line>We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,</line>

            <line>In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:</line>

            <line>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</line>
            <line>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</line>
            <line>And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,</line>
            <line>And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</line>
            <line>And frame my face to all occasions.</line>
            <line>I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;</line>

            <line>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</line>
            <line>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.</line>
            <line>Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</line>

            <line>Our people and our peers are both misled,</line>

            <line>Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,</line>
            <line>But from deceit bred by necessity;</line>
            <line>For how can tyrants safely govern home,</line>
            <line>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</line>
            <line>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</line>
            <line>That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,</line>
            <line>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.</line>
            <line>Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</line>
            <line>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;</line>
            <line>For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,</line>

            <line>Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:</line>

            <line>Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;</line>
            <line>And, as occasion serves, this noble queen</line>
            <line>And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.</line>
            <line>Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,</line>
            <line>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
            <line>This shall assure my constant loyalty,</line>
            <line>That if our queen and this young prince agree,</line>
            <line>I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
            <line>Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.</line>
            <line>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,</line>
            <line>Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;</line>
            <line>And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,</line>

            <line>Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,</line>
            <line>And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,</line>
            <line>Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.</line>
            <line>I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt all but WARWICK</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
            <line>I came from Edward as ambassador,</line>
            <line>But I return his sworn and mortal foe:</line>
            <line>Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,</line>
            <line>But dreadful war shall answer his demand.</line>
            <line>Had he none else to make a stale but me?</line>
            <line>Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.</line>
            <line>I was the chief that raised him to the crown,</line>
            <line>And I'll be chief to bring him down again:</line>
            <line>Not that I pity Henry's misery,</line>
            <line>But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.</line>

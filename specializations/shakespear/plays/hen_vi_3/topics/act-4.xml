            <line>Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?</line>
            <line>Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?</line>

            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,</line>
            <line>That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,</line>
            <line>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</line>
            <line>That they'll take no offence at our abuse.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Suppose they take offence without a cause,</line>
            <line>They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,</line>
            <line>Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>And shall have your will, because our king:</line>
            <line>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Not I:</line>
            <line>No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd</line>
            <line>Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity</line>
            <line>To sunder them that yoke so well together.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</line>
            <line>Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey</line>
            <line>Should not become my wife and England's queen.</line>
            <line>And you too, Somerset and Montague,</line>
            <line>Speak freely what you think.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</line>
            <line>Becomes your enemy, for mocking him</line>
            <line>About the marriage of the Lady Bona.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</line>
            <line>Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased</line>
            <line>By such invention as I can devise?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
            <line>Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance</line>
            <line>Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth</line>
            <line>'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>Why, knows not Montague that of itself</line>
            <line>England is safe, if true within itself?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
            <line>But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>'Tis better using France than trusting France:</line>
            <line>Let us be back'd with God and with the seas</line>
            <line>Which He hath given for fence impregnable,</line>
            <line>And with their helps only defend ourselves;</line>
            <line>In them and in ourselves our safety lies.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves</line>
            <line>To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;</line>
            <line>And for this once my will shall stand for law.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,</line>
            <line>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</line>
            <line>Unto the brother of your loving bride;</line>
            <line>She better would have fitted me or Clarence:</line>
            <line>But in your bride you bury brotherhood.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir</line>
            <line>Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,</line>
            <line>And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife</line>
            <line>That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,</line>
            <line>Which being shallow, you give me leave</line>
            <line>To play the broker in mine own behalf;</line>
            <line>And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,</line>

            <speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
            <line>My lords, before it pleased his majesty</line>
            <line>To raise my state to title of a queen,</line>
            <line>Do me but right, and you must all confess</line>
            <line>That I was not ignoble of descent;</line>
            <line>And meaner than myself have had like fortune.</line>
            <line>But as this title honours me and mine,</line>
            <line>So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,</line>
            <line>Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:</line>
            <line>What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,</line>
            <line>So long as Edward is thy constant friend,</line>
            <line>And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?</line>
            <line>Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,</line>
            <line>Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;</line>
            <line>Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,</line>
            <line>And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.</line>

            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Now, messenger, what letters or what news</line>
            <line>From France?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Post</speaker>
            <line>My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,</line>
            <line>But such as I, without your special pardon,</line>
            <line>Dare not relate.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,</line>
            <line>Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.</line>
            <line>What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Post</speaker>
            <line>At my depart, these were his very words:</line>
            <line>'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</line>
            <line>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</line>
            <line>To revel it with him and his new bride.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.</line>
            <line>But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Post</speaker>
            <line>These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:</line>
            <line>'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,</line>
            <line>I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>I blame not her, she could say little less;</line>
            <line>She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?</line>
            <line>For I have heard that she was there in place.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Post</speaker>
            <line>'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,</line>
            <line>And I am ready to put armour on.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Belike she minds to play the Amazon.</line>
            <line>But what said Warwick to these injuries?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Post</speaker>
            <line>He, more incensed against your majesty</line>
            <line>Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:</line>
            <line>'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</line>
            <line>And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'</line>

            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?</line>
            <line>Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:</line>
            <line>They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.</line>
            <line>But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Post</speaker>
            <line>Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in</line>
            <line>friendship</line>
            <line>That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.</line>
            <line>Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,</line>
            <line>For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;</line>
            <line>That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage</line>
            <line>I may not prove inferior to yourself.</line>
            <line>You that love me and Warwick, follow me.</line>

            <line>Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;</line>
            <line>And haste is needful in this desperate case.</line>
            <line>Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf</line>
            <line>Go levy men, and make prepare for war;</line>
            <line>They are already, or quickly will be landed:</line>
            <line>Myself in person will straight follow you.</line>
            <stagedir>Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD</stagedir>
            <line>But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,</line>
            <line>Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,</line>
            <line>Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:</line>
            <line>Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?</line>
            <line>If it be so, then both depart to him;</line>
            <line>I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:</line>
            <line>But if you mind to hold your true obedience,</line>
            <line>Give me assurance with some friendly vow,</line>
            <line>That I may never have you in suspect.</line>

            <speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
            <line>Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:</line>
            <line>The king by this is set him down to sleep.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
            <line>Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow</line>
            <line>Never to lie and take his natural rest</line>
            <line>Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Watchman</speaker>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Watchman</speaker>
            <line>But say, I pray, what nobleman is that</line>
            <line>That with the king here resteth in his tent?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
            <line>'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Watchman</speaker>
            <line>O, is it so? But why commands the king</line>
            <line>That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,</line>
            <line>While he himself keeps in the cold field?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Watchman</speaker>
            <line>'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Watchman</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but give me worship and quietness;</line>
            <line>I like it better than a dangerous honour.</line>
            <line>If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,</line>
            <line>'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Watchman</speaker>
            <line>Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,</line>
            <line>But to defend his person from night-foes?</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and
French soldiers, silent all</stagedir>

            <line>Courage, my masters! honour now or never!</line>
            <line>But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but the case is alter'd:</line>
            <line>When you disgraced me in my embassade,</line>
            <line>Then I degraded you from being king,</line>
            <line>And come now to create you Duke of York.</line>
            <line>Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,</line>

            <line>Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,</line>
            <line>Nor how to study for the people's welfare,</line>

            <line>Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?</line>
            <line>Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.</line>
            <line>Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,</line>
            <line>Of thee thyself and all thy complices,</line>
            <line>Edward will always bear himself as king:</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
            <line>Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:</line>
            <stagedir>Takes off his crown</stagedir>
            <line>But Henry now shall wear the English crown,</line>
            <line>And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.</line>
            <line>My Lord of Somerset, at my request,</line>
            <line>See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd</line>
            <line>Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.</line>
            <line>When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,</line>
            <line>I'll follow you, and tell what answer</line>
            <line>Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.</line>
            <line>Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.</line>

            <line>Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Here at the palace I will rest awhile.</line>
            <line>Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?</line>
            <line>Methinks the power that Edward hath in field</line>
            <line>Should not be able to encounter mine.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EXETER</speaker>
            <line>The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:</line>
            <line>I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,</line>
            <line>Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;</line>
            <line>My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,</line>
            <line>My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,</line>
            <line>My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;</line>
            <line>I have not been desirous of their wealth,</line>
            <line>Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.</line>
            <line>Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:</line>
            <line>Then why should they love Edward more than me?</line>
            <line>No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:</line>
            <line>And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,</line>
            <line>The lamb will never cease to follow him.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!'</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EXETER</speaker>
            <line>Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;</line>
            <line>And once again proclaim us King of England.</line>
            <line>You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:</line>
            <line>Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,</line>
            <line>And swell so much the higher by their ebb.</line>
            <line>Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.</line>
            <stagedir>Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI</stagedir>
            <line>And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course</line>
            <line>Where peremptory Warwick now remains:</line>
            <line>The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,</line>
            <line>Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Away betimes, before his forces join,</line>
            <line>And take the great-grown traitor unawares:</line>
            <line>Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.</line>
            <stagedir>Exeunt</stagedir>

            <line>While we pursued the horsemen of the north,</line>
            <line>He slily stole away and left his men:</line>
            <line>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</line>
            <line>Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</line>
            <line>Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,</line>

            <line>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</line>
            <line>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</line>
            <line>This is the palace of the fearful king,</line>

            <line>The queen this day here holds her parliament,</line>

            <line>Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,</line>

            <line>Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.</line>
            <line>I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:</line>

            <line>My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</line>
            <line>Even in the chair of state: belike he means,</line>
            <line>Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</line>
            <line>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</line>
            <line>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.</line>
            <line>And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge</line>
            <line>On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
            <line>What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:</line>
            <line>My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.</line>
         </speech>

            <line>My gracious lord, here in the parliament</line>
            <line>Let us assail the family of York.</line>

            <line>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats</line>
            <line>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</line>

            <line>She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,</line>
            <line>Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!</line>
            <line>How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex</line>
            <line>To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,</line>
            <line>Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!</line>
            <line>But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,</line>
            <line>Made impudent with use of evil deeds,</line>
            <line>I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.</line>
            <line>To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,</line>
            <line>Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.</line>
            <line>Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,</line>
            <line>Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,</line>
            <line>Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.</line>
            <line>Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?</line>
            <line>It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,</line>
            <line>Unless the adage must be verified,</line>
            <line>That beggars mounted run their horse to death.</line>
            <line>'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;</line>
            <line>But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:</line>
            <line>'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;</line>
            <line>The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:</line>
            <line>'Tis government that makes them seem divine;</line>
            <line>The want thereof makes thee abominable:</line>
            <line>Thou art as opposite to every good</line>
            <line>As the Antipodes are unto us,</line>
            <line>Or as the south to the septentrion.</line>
            <line>O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!</line>
            <line>How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,</line>
            <line>To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,</line>
            <line>And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?</line>
            <line>Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;</line>
            <line>Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.</line>
            <line>Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:</line>
            <line>Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:</line>
            <line>For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</line>
            <line>And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</line>
            <line>These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:</line>
            <line>And every drop cries vengeance for his death,</line>
            <line>'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false</line>
            <line>Frenchwoman.</line>

            <line>But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,</line>
            <line>O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.</line>
            <line>See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:</line>
            <line>This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,</line>
            <line>And I with tears do wash the blood away.</line>
            <line>Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:</line>
            <line>And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,</line>
            <line>Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;</line>
            <line>Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,</line>
            <line>And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'</line>
            <line>There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;</line>
            <line>And in thy need such comfort come to thee</line>
            <line>As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!</line>
            <line>Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:</line>

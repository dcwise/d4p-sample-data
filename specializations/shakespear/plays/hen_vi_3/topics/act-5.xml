            <line>I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,</line>

            <line>Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,</line>

            <line>That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,</line>
            <line>To bend the fatal instruments of war</line>
            <line>Against his brother and his lawful king?</line>
            <line>Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:</line>
            <line>To keep that oath were more impiety</line>
            <line>Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.</line>
            <line>I am so sorry for my trespass made</line>

            <line>Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,</line>

            <line>What though the mast be now blown overboard,</line>
            <line>The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,</line>
            <line>And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?</line>
            <line>Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he</line>

            <line>Which industry and courage might have saved?</line>
            <line>Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!</line>
            <line>Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?</line>
            <line>And Montague our topmost; what of him?</line>
            <line>Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?</line>
            <line>Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?</line>

            <line>The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?</line>

            <line>From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.</line>
            <line>As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.</line>

            <line>What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?</line>

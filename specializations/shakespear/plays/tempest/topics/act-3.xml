            <line>There be some sports are painful, and their labour</line>
            <line>Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness</line>
            <line>Are nobly undergone and most poor matters</line>
            <line>Point to rich ends. This my mean task</line>
            <line>Would be as heavy to me as odious, but</line>
            <line>The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead</line>
            <line>And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is</line>
            <line>Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,</line>
            <line>And he's composed of harshness. I must remove</line>
            <line>Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,</line>
            <line>Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress</line>
            <line>Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness</line>
            <line>Had never like executor. I forget:</line>
            <line>But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,</line>
            <line>Most busy lest, when I do it.</line>

            <line>Alas, now, pray you,</line>
            <line>Work not so hard: I would the lightning had</line>
            <line>Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!</line>
            <line>Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,</line>
            <line>'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father</line>

         </speech>

            <speaker>MIRANDA</speaker>
            <line>It would become me</line>

            <line>The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage</line>
            <line>Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues</line>
            <line>Have I liked several women; never any</line>
            <line>With so fun soul, but some defect in her</line>
            <line>Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed</line>
            <line>And put it to the foil: but you, O you,</line>
            <line>So perfect and so peerless, are created</line>
            <line>Of every creature's best!</line>

            <line>One of my sex; no woman's face remember,</line>

            <line>And my dear father: how features are abroad,</line>
            <line>I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,</line>
            <line>The jewel in my dower, I would not wish</line>
            <line>Any companion in the world but you,</line>
            <line>Nor can imagination form a shape,</line>
            <line>Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle</line>

            <line>I would, not so!--and would no more endure</line>
            <line>This wooden slavery than to suffer</line>
            <line>The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:</line>
            <line>The very instant that I saw you, did</line>
            <line>My heart fly to your service; there resides,</line>

            <line>And crown what I profess with kind event</line>
            <line>If I speak true! if hollowly, invert</line>

            <line>Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou</line>
            <line>Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:</line>
            <line>Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated</line>
            <line>In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life</line>
            <line>And observation strange, my meaner ministers</line>
            <line>Their several kinds have done. My high charms work</line>

            <line>In their distractions; they now are in my power;</line>

            <line>The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,</line>

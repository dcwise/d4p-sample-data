            <line>So have we all, of joy; for our escape</line>
            <line>Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe</line>
            <line>Is common; every day some sailor's wife,</line>
            <line>The masters of some merchant and the merchant</line>

            <line>Dolour comes to him, indeed: you</line>

            <line>Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.</line>

            <line>It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate</line>
            <line>temperance.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>Temperance was a delicate wench.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
            <line>The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.</line>

            <line>Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.</line>

            <line>Here is everything advantageous to life.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>True; save means to live.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>Of that there's none, or little.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>The ground indeed is tawny.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>With an eye of green in't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>He misses not much.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>As many vouched rarities are.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in</line>
            <line>the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and</line>
            <line>glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with</line>
            <line>salt water.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we</line>
            <line>put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of</line>
            <line>the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
            <line>Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to</line>
            <line>their queen.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>Not since widow Dido's time.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?</line>
            <line>widow Dido!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,</line>
            <line>how you take it!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
            <line>'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:</line>
            <line>she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIAN</speaker>
            <line>Carthage?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>I assure you, Carthage.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath</line>
            <line>raised the wall and houses too.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>What impossible matter will he make easy next?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>I think he will carry this island home in his pocket</line>
            <line>and give it his son for an apple.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring</line>
            <line>forth more islands.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>Ay.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>Why, in good time.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now</line>
            <line>as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage</line>
            <line>of your daughter, who is now queen.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>And the rarest that e'er came there.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I</line>
            <line>wore it? I mean, in a sort.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
            <line>That sort was well fished for.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>You cram these words into mine ears against</line>
            <line>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</line>
            <line>Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,</line>
            <line>My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,</line>
            <line>Who is so far from Italy removed</line>
            <line>I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</line>
            <line>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</line>
            <line>Hath made his meal on thee?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRANCISCO</speaker>
            <line>Sir, he may live:</line>
            <line>I saw him beat the surges under him,</line>
            <line>And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,</line>
            <line>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</line>
            <line>The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head</line>
            <line>'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd</line>
            <line>Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</line>
            <line>To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,</line>
            <line>As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt</line>
            <line>He came alive to land.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>No, no, he's gone.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</line>
            <line>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</line>
            <line>But rather lose her to an African;</line>
            <line>Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,</line>
            <line>Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>Prithee, peace.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>
            <line>You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise</line>
            <line>By all of us, and the fair soul herself</line>
            <line>Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at</line>
            <line>Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your</line>
            <line>son,</line>
            <line>I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have</line>
            <line>More widows in them of this business' making</line>
            <line>Than we bring men to comfort them:</line>
            <line>The fault's your own.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>So is the dear'st o' the loss.</line>

            <line>My lord Sebastian,</line>
            <line>The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness</line>
            <line>And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,</line>
            <line>When you should bring the plaster.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>

      <title>SCENE I.  Before PROSPERO'S cell.</title>
      <scene-body>
         <stagedir>Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>Now does my project gather to a head:</line>
            <line>My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time</line>
            <line>Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
            <line>On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,</line>
            <line>You said our work should cease.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>I did say so,</line>
            <line>When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,</line>
            <line>How fares the king and's followers?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
            <line>Confined together</line>
            <line>In the same fashion as you gave in charge,</line>
            <line>Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,</line>
            <line>In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;</line>
            <line>They cannot budge till your release. The king,</line>
            <line>His brother and yours, abide all three distracted</line>
            <line>And the remainder mourning over them,</line>
            <line>Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly</line>
            <line>Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'</line>
            <line>His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops</line>
            <line>From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em</line>
            <line>That if you now beheld them, your affections</line>
            <line>Would become tender.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>Dost thou think so, spirit?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
            <line>Mine would, sir, were I human.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>And mine shall.</line>
            <line>Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling</line>
            <line>Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,</line>
            <line>One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,</line>
            <line>Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?</line>
            <line>Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,</line>
            <line>Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury</line>
            <line>Do I take part: the rarer action is</line>
            <line>In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,</line>
            <line>The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</line>
            <line>Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:</line>
            <line>My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,</line>
            <line>And they shall be themselves.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
            <line>I'll fetch them, sir.</line>

         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,</line>
            <line>And ye that on the sands with printless foot</line>
            <line>Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him</line>
            <line>When he comes back; you demi-puppets that</line>
            <line>By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,</line>
            <line>Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime</line>
            <line>Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice</line>
            <line>To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,</line>
            <line>Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd</line>
            <line>The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,</line>
            <line>And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault</line>
            <line>Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder</line>
            <line>Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak</line>
            <line>With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory</line>
            <line>Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up</line>
            <line>The pine and cedar: graves at my command</line>
            <line>Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth</line>
            <line>By my so potent art. But this rough magic</line>
            <line>I here abjure, and, when I have required</line>
            <line>Some heavenly music, which even now I do,</line>
            <line>To work mine end upon their senses that</line>
            <line>This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,</line>
            <line>Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,</line>
            <line>And deeper than did ever plummet sound</line>
            <line>I'll drown my book.</line>
            <stagedir>Solemn music</stagedir>
            <stagedir>Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a
frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;
SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,
attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all
enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,
and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO
observing, speaks:</stagedir>
            <line>A solemn air and the best comforter</line>
            <line>To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,</line>
            <line>Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,</line>
            <line>For you are spell-stopp'd.</line>
            <line>Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,</line>
            <line>Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,</line>
            <line>Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,</line>
            <line>And as the morning steals upon the night,</line>
            <line>Melting the darkness, so their rising senses</line>
            <line>Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle</line>
            <line>Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,</line>
            <line>My true preserver, and a loyal sir</line>
            <line>To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces</line>
            <line>Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly</line>
            <line>Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:</line>
            <line>Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.</line>
            <line>Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,</line>
            <line>You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,</line>
            <line>Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,</line>
            <line>Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,</line>
            <line>Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,</line>
            <line>Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding</line>
            <line>Begins to swell, and the approaching tide</line>
            <line>Will shortly fill the reasonable shore</line>
            <line>That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them</line>
            <line>That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,</line>
            <line>Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:</line>
            <line>I will discase me, and myself present</line>
            <line>As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;</line>
            <line>Thou shalt ere long be free.</line>
            <stagedir>ARIEL sings and helps to attire him</stagedir>
            <line>Where the bee sucks. there suck I:</line>
            <line>In a cowslip's bell I lie;</line>
            <line>There I couch when owls do cry.</line>
            <line>On the bat's back I do fly</line>
            <line>After summer merrily.</line>
            <line>Merrily, merrily shall I live now</line>
            <line>Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:</line>
            <line>But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.</line>
            <line>To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:</line>
            <line>There shalt thou find the mariners asleep</line>
            <line>Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain</line>
            <line>Being awake, enforce them to this place,</line>
            <line>And presently, I prithee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARIEL</speaker>
            <line>I drink the air before me, and return</line>
            <line>Or ere your pulse twice beat.</line>

            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement</line>
            <line>Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us</line>
            <line>Out of this fearful country!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>Behold, sir king,</line>
            <line>The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:</line>
            <line>For more assurance that a living prince</line>
            <line>Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;</line>
            <line>And to thee and thy company I bid</line>
            <line>A hearty welcome.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>Whether thou best he or no,</line>
            <line>Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,</line>
            <line>As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse</line>
            <line>Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,</line>
            <line>The affliction of my mind amends, with which,</line>
            <line>I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,</line>
            <line>An if this be at all, a most strange story.</line>
            <line>Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat</line>
            <line>Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero</line>
            <line>Be living and be here?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>First, noble friend,</line>
            <line>Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot</line>
            <line>Be measured or confined.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONZALO</speaker>
            <line>Whether this be</line>
            <line>Or be not, I'll not swear.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>You do yet taste</line>
            <line>Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you</line>
            <line>Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!</line>
            <stagedir>Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO</stagedir>
            <line>But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,</line>
            <line>I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you</line>
            <line>And justify you traitors: at this time</line>
            <line>I will tell no tales.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SEBASTIAN</speaker>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>No.</line>
            <line>For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother</line>
            <line>Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive</line>
            <line>Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require</line>
            <line>My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,</line>
            <line>Thou must restore.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>If thou be'st Prospero,</line>
            <line>Give us particulars of thy preservation;</line>
            <line>How thou hast met us here, who three hours since</line>
            <line>Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--</line>
            <line>How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--</line>
            <line>My dear son Ferdinand.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>I am woe for't, sir.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>Irreparable is the loss, and patience</line>
            <line>Says it is past her cure.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>I rather think</line>
            <line>You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace</line>
            <line>For the like loss I have her sovereign aid</line>
            <line>And rest myself content.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>You the like loss!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>As great to me as late; and, supportable</line>
            <line>To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker</line>
            <line>Than you may call to comfort you, for I</line>
            <line>Have lost my daughter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALONSO</speaker>
            <line>A daughter?</line>
            <line>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</line>
            <line>The king and queen there! that they were, I wish</line>
            <line>Myself were mudded in that oozy bed</line>
            <line>Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PROSPERO</speaker>
            <line>In this last tempest. I perceive these lords</line>
            <line>At this encounter do so much admire</line>
            <line>That they devour their reason and scarce think</line>
            <line>Their eyes do offices of truth, their words</line>
            <line>Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have</line>
            <line>Been justled from your senses, know for certain</line>
            <line>That I am Prospero and that very duke</line>
            <line>Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely</line>
            <line>Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,</line>
            <line>To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;</line>
            <line>For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,</line>
            <line>Not a relation for a breakfast nor</line>
            <line>Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;</line>
            <line>This cell's my court: here have I few attendants</line>
            <line>And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.</line>
            <line>My dukedom since you have given me again,</line>
            <line>I will requite you with as good a thing;</line>
            <line>At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye</line>
            <line>As much as me my dukedom.</line>

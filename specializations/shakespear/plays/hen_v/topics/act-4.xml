            <speaker>Chorus</speaker>
            <line>Now entertain conjecture of a time</line>
            <line>When creeping murmur and the poring dark</line>
            <line>Fills the wide vessel of the universe.</line>
            <line>From camp to camp through the foul womb of night</line>
            <line>The hum of either army stilly sounds,</line>
            <line>That the fixed sentinels almost receive</line>
            <line>The secret whispers of each other's watch:</line>
            <line>Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames</line>
            <line>Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;</line>
            <line>Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs</line>
            <line>Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents</line>
            <line>The armourers, accomplishing the knights,</line>
            <line>With busy hammers closing rivets up,</line>
            <line>Give dreadful note of preparation:</line>
            <line>The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,</line>
            <line>And the third hour of drowsy morning name.</line>
            <line>Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,</line>
            <line>The confident and over-lusty French</line>
            <line>Do the low-rated English play at dice;</line>
            <line>And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night</line>
            <line>Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp</line>
            <line>So tediously away. The poor condemned English,</line>
            <line>Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires</line>
            <line>Sit patiently and inly ruminate</line>
            <line>The morning's danger, and their gesture sad</line>
            <line>Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats</line>
            <line>Presenteth them unto the gazing moon</line>
            <line>So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold</line>
            <line>The royal captain of this ruin'd band</line>
            <line>Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,</line>
            <line>Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'</line>
            <line>For forth he goes and visits all his host.</line>
            <line>Bids them good morrow with a modest smile</line>
            <line>And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.</line>
            <line>Upon his royal face there is no note</line>
            <line>How dread an army hath enrounded him;</line>
            <line>Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour</line>
            <line>Unto the weary and all-watched night,</line>
            <line>But freshly looks and over-bears attaint</line>
            <line>With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;</line>
            <line>That every wretch, pining and pale before,</line>
            <line>Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:</line>
            <line>A largess universal like the sun</line>
            <line>His liberal eye doth give to every one,</line>
            <line>Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,</line>
            <line>Behold, as may unworthiness define,</line>
            <line>A little touch of Harry in the night.</line>
            <line>And so our scene must to the battle fly;</line>
            <line>Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace</line>
            <line>With four or five most vile and ragged foils,</line>
            <line>Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,</line>
            <line>The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,</line>
            <line>Minding true things by what their mockeries be.</line>

            <line>The greater therefore should our courage be.</line>
            <line>Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!</line>
            <line>There is some soul of goodness in things evil,</line>
            <line>Would men observingly distil it out.</line>
            <line>For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,</line>
            <line>Which is both healthful and good husbandry:</line>
            <line>Besides, they are our outward consciences,</line>
            <line>And preachers to us all, admonishing</line>
            <line>That we should dress us fairly for our end.</line>
            <line>Thus may we gather honey from the weed,</line>

            <line>So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It is</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>WILLIAMS</speaker>
            <line>A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I</line>
            <line>pray you, what thinks he of our estate?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY V</speaker>
            <line>Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be</line>
            <line>washed off the next tide.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BATES</speaker>
            <line>He hath not told his thought to the king?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY V</speaker>
            <line>No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I</line>
            <line>speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I</line>
            <line>am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the</line>
            <line>element shows to him as it doth to me; all his</line>
            <line>senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies</line>
            <line>laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and</line>
            <line>though his affections are higher mounted than ours,</line>
            <line>yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like</line>
            <line>wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we</line>
            <line>do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish</line>
            <line>as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess</line>
            <line>him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing</line>
            <line>it, should dishearten his army.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BATES</speaker>
            <line>He may show what outward courage he will; but I</line>
            <line>believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish</line>
            <line>himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he</line>
            <line>were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY V</speaker>
            <line>By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:</line>
            <line>I think he would not wish himself any where but</line>
            <line>where he is.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BATES</speaker>
            <line>Then I would he were here alone; so should he be</line>
            <line>sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY V</speaker>
            <line>I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here</line>
            <line>alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's</line>
            <line>minds: methinks I could not die any where so</line>
            <line>contented as in the king's company; his cause being</line>
            <line>just and his quarrel honourable.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WILLIAMS</speaker>
            <line>That's more than we know.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BATES</speaker>
            <line>Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know</line>
            <line>enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if</line>
            <line>his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes</line>

            <line>But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath</line>
            <line>a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and</line>
            <line>arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join</line>
            <line>together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at</line>
            <line>such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a</line>
            <line>surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind</line>
            <line>them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their</line>
            <line>children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die</line>
            <line>well that die in a battle; for how can they</line>
            <line>charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their</line>
            <line>argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it</line>
            <line>will be a black matter for the king that led them to</line>
            <line>it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of</line>

            <speaker>KING HENRY V</speaker>
            <line>So, if a son that is by his father sent about</line>
            <line>merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the</line>
            <line>imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be</line>
            <line>imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a</line>
            <line>servant, under his master's command transporting a</line>
            <line>sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in</line>
            <line>many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</line>
            <line>business of the master the author of the servant's</line>
            <line>damnation: but this is not so: the king is not</line>
            <line>bound to answer the particular endings of his</line>
            <line>soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</line>
            <line>his servant; for they purpose not their death, when</line>
            <line>they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</line>
            <line>king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</line>
            <line>the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</line>
            <line>unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</line>
            <line>the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;</line>
            <line>some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</line>
            <line>perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that</line>
            <line>have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with</line>
            <line>pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have</line>
            <line>defeated the law and outrun native punishment,</line>
            <line>though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</line>
            <line>fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;</line>
            <line>so that here men are punished for before-breach of</line>
            <line>the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</line>
            <line>they feared the death, they have borne life away;</line>
            <line>and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</line>
            <line>they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</line>
            <line>their damnation than he was before guilty of those</line>
            <line>impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</line>
            <line>subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's</line>
            <line>soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</line>
            <line>the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</line>
            <line>mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</line>
            <line>is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was</line>
            <line>blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:</line>
            <line>and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think</line>
            <line>that, making God so free an offer, He let him</line>
            <line>outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach</line>

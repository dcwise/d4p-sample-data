            <speaker>Chorus</speaker>
            <line>Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies</line>
            <line>In motion of no less celerity</line>
            <line>Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen</line>
            <line>The well-appointed king at Hampton pier</line>
            <line>Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet</line>
            <line>With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:</line>
            <line>Play with your fancies, and in them behold</line>
            <line>Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;</line>
            <line>Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give</line>
            <line>To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,</line>
            <line>Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,</line>
            <line>Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,</line>
            <line>Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think</line>
            <line>You stand upon the ravage and behold</line>
            <line>A city on the inconstant billows dancing;</line>
            <line>For so appears this fleet majestical,</line>
            <line>Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:</line>
            <line>Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,</line>
            <line>And leave your England, as dead midnight still,</line>
            <line>Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,</line>
            <line>Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;</line>
            <line>For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd</line>
            <line>With one appearing hair, that will not follow</line>
            <line>These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?</line>
            <line>Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;</line>
            <line>Behold the ordnance on their carriages,</line>
            <line>With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.</line>
            <line>Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;</line>
            <line>Tells Harry that the king doth offer him</line>
            <line>Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,</line>
            <line>Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</line>
            <line>The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner</line>
            <line>With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,</line>
            <stagedir>Alarum, and chambers go off</stagedir>
            <line>And down goes all before them. Still be kind,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Boy</speaker>
            <line>As young as I am, I have observed these three</line>
            <line>swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they</line>
            <line>three, though they would serve me, could not be man</line>
            <line>to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to</line>
            <line>a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and</line>
            <line>red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</line>
            <line>fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</line>
            <line>and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</line>
            <line>words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</line>
            <line>heard that men of few words are the best men; and</line>
            <line>therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</line>
            <line>should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</line>
            <line>are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</line>
            <line>broke any man's head but his own, and that was</line>
            <line>against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</line>
            <line>any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</line>
            <line>lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</line>
            <line>three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</line>
            <line>brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</line>
            <line>fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</line>
            <line>men would carry coals. They would have me as</line>
            <line>familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</line>
            <line>handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</line>
            <line>if I should take from another's pocket to put into</line>
            <line>mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I</line>
            <line>must leave them, and seek some better service:</line>
            <line>their villany goes against my weak stomach, and</line>
            <line>therefore I must cast it up.</line>

            <speaker>FLUELLEN</speaker>
            <line>By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is</line>

            <line>painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which</line>
            <line>is the moral of it, that she is turning, and</line>
            <line>inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her</line>
            <line>foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,</line>
            <line>which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,</line>
            <line>the poet makes a most excellent description of it:</line>

            <line>Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;</line>

            <line>Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free</line>
            <line>And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:</line>
            <line>But Exeter hath given the doom of death</line>
            <line>For pax of little price.</line>
            <line>Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:</line>
            <line>And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut</line>
            <line>With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:</line>
            <line>Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.</line>

            <line>fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:</line>
            <line>and they will learn you by rote where services were</line>
            <line>done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,</line>
            <line>at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was</line>
            <line>shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;</line>
            <line>and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,</line>
            <line>which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what</line>

            <line>could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we</line>
            <line>thought not good to bruise an injury till it were</line>
            <line>full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice</line>
            <line>is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see</line>
            <line>his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him</line>
            <line>therefore consider of his ransom; which must</line>
            <line>proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we</line>
            <line>have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in</line>
            <line>weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.</line>
            <line>For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the</line>
            <line>effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too</line>
            <line>faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own</line>
            <line>person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and</line>
            <line>worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and</line>

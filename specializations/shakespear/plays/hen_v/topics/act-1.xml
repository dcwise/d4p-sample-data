            <speaker>Chorus</speaker>
            <line>O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend</line>
            <line>The brightest heaven of invention,</line>
            <line>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act</line>
            <line>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</line>
            <line>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</line>
            <line>Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,</line>
            <line>Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire</line>
            <line>Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,</line>
            <line>The flat unraised spirits that have dared</line>
            <line>On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</line>
            <line>So great an object: can this cockpit hold</line>
            <line>The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</line>
            <line>Within this wooden O the very casques</line>
            <line>That did affright the air at Agincourt?</line>
            <line>O, pardon! since a crooked figure may</line>
            <line>Attest in little place a million;</line>
            <line>And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,</line>
            <line>On your imaginary forces work.</line>
            <line>Suppose within the girdle of these walls</line>
            <line>Are now confined two mighty monarchies,</line>
            <line>Whose high upreared and abutting fronts</line>
            <line>The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:</line>
            <line>Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;</line>
            <line>Into a thousand parts divide on man,</line>
            <line>And make imaginary puissance;</line>
            <line>Think when we talk of horses, that you see them</line>
            <line>Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;</line>
            <line>For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</line>
            <line>Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,</line>
            <line>Turning the accomplishment of many years</line>
            <line>Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CANTERBURY</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,</line>
            <line>Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign</line>
            <line>Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,</line>
            <line>But that the scambling and unquiet time</line>
            <line>Did push it out of farther question.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ELY</speaker>
            <line>But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CANTERBURY</speaker>
            <line>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</line>
            <line>We lose the better half of our possession:</line>
            <line>For all the temporal lands which men devout</line>
            <line>By testament have given to the church</line>
            <line>Would they strip from us; being valued thus:</line>
            <line>As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,</line>
            <line>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</line>
            <line>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</line>
            <line>And, to relief of lazars and weak age,</line>
            <line>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.</line>
            <line>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</line>
            <line>And to the coffers of the king beside,</line>
            <line>A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.</line>

            <line>The courses of his youth promised it not.</line>
            <line>The breath no sooner left his father's body,</line>
            <line>But that his wildness, mortified in him,</line>
            <line>Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment</line>
            <line>Consideration, like an angel, came</line>
            <line>And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,</line>
            <line>Leaving his body as a paradise,</line>
            <line>To envelop and contain celestial spirits.</line>
            <line>Never was such a sudden scholar made;</line>
            <line>Never came reformation in a flood,</line>
            <line>With such a heady currance, scouring faults</line>
            <line>Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness</line>
            <line>So soon did lose his seat and all at once</line>
            <line>As in this king.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ELY</speaker>
            <line>We are blessed in the change.</line>

            <speaker>CANTERBURY</speaker>
            <line>Hear him but reason in divinity,</line>
            <line>And all-admiring with an inward wish</line>
            <line>You would desire the king were made a prelate:</line>
            <line>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</line>
            <line>You would say it hath been all in all his study:</line>
            <line>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</line>
            <line>A fearful battle render'd you in music:</line>
            <line>Turn him to any cause of policy,</line>
            <line>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</line>
            <line>Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,</line>
            <line>The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,</line>
            <line>And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,</line>
            <line>To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;</line>
            <line>So that the art and practic part of life</line>
            <line>Must be the mistress to this theoric:</line>
            <line>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</line>
            <line>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</line>
            <line>His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,</line>
            <line>His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,</line>
            <line>And never noted in him any study,</line>
            <line>Any retirement, any sequestration</line>
            <line>From open haunts and popularity.</line>

            <line>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle</line>
            <line>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</line>
            <line>Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:</line>
            <line>And so the prince obscured his contemplation</line>
            <line>Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,</line>
            <line>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</line>
            <line>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CANTERBURY</speaker>
            <line>It must be so; for miracles are ceased;</line>
            <line>And therefore we must needs admit the means</line>
            <line>How things are perfected.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ELY</speaker>
            <line>But, my good lord,</line>
            <line>How now for mitigation of this bill</line>
            <line>Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty</line>
            <line>Incline to it, or no?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CANTERBURY</speaker>
            <line>He seems indifferent,</line>
            <line>Or rather swaying more upon our part</line>
            <line>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;</line>
            <line>For I have made an offer to his majesty,</line>
            <line>Upon our spiritual convocation</line>
            <line>And in regard of causes now in hand,</line>
            <line>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,</line>
            <line>As touching France, to give a greater sum</line>
            <line>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</line>
            <line>Did to his predecessors part withal.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ELY</speaker>
            <line>How did this offer seem received, my lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CANTERBURY</speaker>
            <line>With good acceptance of his majesty;</line>
            <line>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</line>
            <line>As I perceived his grace would fain have done,</line>
            <line>The severals and unhidden passages</line>
            <line>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms</line>
            <line>And generally to the crown and seat of France</line>
            <line>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</line>

            <speaker>CANTERBURY</speaker>
            <line>The French ambassador upon that instant</line>

            <line>Then go we in, to know his embassy;</line>
            <line>Which I could with a ready guess declare,</line>
            <line>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</line>

            <line>God and his angels guard your sacred throne</line>

            <line>Sure, we thank you.</line>
            <line>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed</line>
            <line>And justly and religiously unfold</line>
            <line>Why the law Salique that they have in France</line>
            <line>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:</line>
            <line>And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</line>
            <line>That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</line>
            <line>Or nicely charge your understanding soul</line>
            <line>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</line>

            <line>Shall drop their blood in approbation</line>
            <line>Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</line>
            <line>Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</line>
            <line>How you awake our sleeping sword of war:</line>
            <line>We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;</line>
            <line>For never two such kingdoms did contend</line>
            <line>Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops</line>
            <line>Are every one a woe, a sore complaint</line>
            <line>'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords</line>
            <line>That make such waste in brief mortality.</line>
            <line>Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;</line>
            <line>For we will hear, note and believe in heart</line>
            <line>That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd</line>
            <line>As pure as sin with baptism.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CANTERBURY</speaker>
            <line>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</line>
            <line>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</line>
            <line>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</line>
            <line>To make against your highness' claim to France</line>
            <line>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</line>
            <line>'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</line>
            <line>'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</line>
            <line>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</line>
            <line>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</line>
            <line>The founder of this law and female bar.</line>
            <line>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</line>
            <line>That the land Salique is in Germany,</line>
            <line>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</line>
            <line>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</line>
            <line>There left behind and settled certain French;</line>
            <line>Who, holding in disdain the German women</line>
            <line>For some dishonest manners of their life,</line>
            <line>Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</line>
            <line>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</line>
            <line>Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</line>
            <line>Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</line>
            <line>Then doth it well appear that Salique law</line>
            <line>Was not devised for the realm of France:</line>
            <line>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</line>
            <line>Until four hundred one and twenty years</line>
            <line>After defunction of King Pharamond,</line>
            <line>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</line>
            <line>Who died within the year of our redemption</line>
            <line>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</line>
            <line>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</line>
            <line>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</line>
            <line>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</line>
            <line>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</line>
            <line>Did, as heir general, being descended</line>
            <line>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</line>
            <line>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</line>
            <line>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</line>
            <line>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</line>
            <line>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</line>
            <line>To find his title with some shows of truth,</line>
            <line>'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</line>
            <line>Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</line>
            <line>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</line>
            <line>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</line>
            <line>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</line>
            <line>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</line>
            <line>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</line>
            <line>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</line>
            <line>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</line>
            <line>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</line>
            <line>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</line>
            <line>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</line>
            <line>Was re-united to the crown of France.</line>
            <line>So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</line>
            <line>King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</line>

         <stagedir>Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:</line>
            <line>Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</line>
            <line>That find such cruel battle here within?</line>
            <line>Each Trojan that is master of his heart,</line>
            <line>Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>Will this gear ne'er be mended?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,</line>
            <line>Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;</line>
            <line>But I am weaker than a woman's tear,</line>
            <line>Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</line>
            <line>Less valiant than the virgin in the night</line>
            <line>And skilless as unpractised infancy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,</line>
            <line>I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will</line>
            <line>have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Have I not tarried?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry</line>
            <line>the bolting.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Still have I tarried.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word</line>
            <line>'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the</line>
            <line>heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must</line>
            <line>stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,</line>
            <line>Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.</line>
            <line>At Priam's royal table do I sit;</line>
            <line>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--</line>
            <line>So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw</line>
            <line>her look, or any woman else.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,</line>
            <line>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</line>
            <line>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</line>
            <line>I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,</line>
            <line>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:</line>
            <line>But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,</line>
            <line>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--</line>
            <line>well, go to--there were no more comparison between</line>
            <line>the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I</line>
            <line>would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would</line>
            <line>somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I</line>
            <line>will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--</line>
            <line>When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,</line>
            <line>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</line>
            <line>They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad</line>
            <line>In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'</line>
            <line>Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart</line>
            <line>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</line>
            <line>Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</line>
            <line>In whose comparison all whites are ink,</line>
            <line>Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure</line>
            <line>The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense</line>
            <line>Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,</line>
            <line>As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;</line>
            <line>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,</line>
            <line>Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me</line>
            <line>The knife that made it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>I speak no more than truth.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Thou dost not speak so much.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:</line>
            <line>if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be</line>
            <line>not, she has the mends in her own hands.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of</line>
            <line>her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and</line>
            <line>between, but small thanks for my labour.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair</line>
            <line>as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as</line>
            <line>fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care</line>
            <line>I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
            <line>Say I she is not fair?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
            <line>I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to</line>
            <line>stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so</line>
            <line>I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,</line>
            <line>I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.</line>

            <line>Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!</line>
            <line>Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,</line>
            <line>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</line>
            <line>I cannot fight upon this argument;</line>
            <line>It is too starved a subject for my sword.</line>
            <line>But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!</line>
            <line>I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;</line>
            <line>And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.</line>
            <line>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</line>
            <line>Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,</line>
            <line>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?</line>
            <line>Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:</line>
            <line>Between our Ilium and where she resides,</line>
            <line>Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,</line>
            <line>Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar</line>

            <line>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</line>
            <line>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores</line>
            <line>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</line>
            <line>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</line>
            <line>And the rude son should strike his father dead:</line>
            <line>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,</line>
            <line>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</line>
            <line>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</line>
            <line>Then every thing includes itself in power,</line>
            <line>Power into will, will into appetite;</line>
            <line>And appetite, an universal wolf,</line>
            <line>So doubly seconded with will and power,</line>
            <line>Must make perforce an universal prey,</line>
            <line>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</line>
            <line>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</line>
            <line>Follows the choking.</line>
            <line>And this neglection of degree it is</line>
            <line>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</line>
            <line>It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd</line>
            <line>By him one step below, he by the next,</line>
            <line>That next by him beneath; so every step,</line>
            <line>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</line>
            <line>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</line>
            <line>Of pale and bloodless emulation:</line>
            <line>And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</line>
            <line>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</line>

            <line>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</line>

            <line>Breaks scurril jests;</line>
            <line>And with ridiculous and awkward action,</line>
            <line>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</line>

            <line>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</line>

            <line>Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming</line>
            <line>He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,</line>
            <line>'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,</line>
            <line>Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd</line>
            <line>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</line>
            <line>The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,</line>
            <line>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;</line>
            <line>Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.</line>
            <line>Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,</line>
            <line>As he being drest to some oration.'</line>
            <line>That's done, as near as the extremest ends</line>
            <line>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:</line>
            <line>Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!</line>

            <line>Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;</line>
            <line>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</line>
            <line>In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,</line>

            <line>And, in the publication, make no strain,</line>
            <line>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</line>
            <line>As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,</line>
            <line>'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,</line>
            <line>Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose</line>
            <line>Pointing on him.</line>

            <line>Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,</line>
            <line>That can from Hector bring his honour off,</line>
            <line>If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,</line>
            <line>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;</line>
            <line>For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute</line>
            <line>With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,</line>
            <line>Our imputation shall be oddly poised</line>
            <line>In this wild action; for the success,</line>
            <line>Although particular, shall give a scantling</line>
            <line>Of good or bad unto the general;</line>
            <line>And in such indexes, although small pricks</line>
            <line>To their subsequent volumes, there is seen</line>
            <line>The baby figure of the giant mass</line>
            <line>Of things to come at large. It is supposed</line>
            <line>He that meets Hector issues from our choice</line>
            <line>And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,</line>
            <line>Makes merit her election, and doth boil,</line>
            <line>As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd</line>
            <line>Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,</line>
            <line>What heart receives from hence the conquering part,</line>
            <line>To steel a strong opinion to themselves?</line>
            <line>Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,</line>
            <line>In no less working than are swords and bows</line>
            <line>Directive by the limbs.</line>

            <line>Give pardon to my speech:</line>
            <line>Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.</line>
            <line>Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,</line>
            <line>And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,</line>
            <line>The lustre of the better yet to show,</line>
            <line>Shall show the better. Do not consent</line>
            <line>That ever Hector and Achilles meet;</line>
            <line>For both our honour and our shame in this</line>
            <line>Are dogg'd with two strange followers.</line>

            <line>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</line>
            <line>Were he not proud, we all should share with him:</line>
            <line>But he already is too insolent;</line>
            <line>And we were better parch in Afric sun</line>
            <line>Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,</line>
            <line>Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,</line>
            <line>Why then, we did our main opinion crush</line>
            <line>In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;</line>
            <line>And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw</line>
            <line>The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves</line>
            <line>Give him allowance for the better man;</line>
            <line>For that will physic the great Myrmidon</line>
            <line>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</line>
            <line>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</line>
            <line>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</line>
            <line>We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,</line>
            <line>Yet go we under our opinion still</line>
            <line>That we have better men. But, hit or miss,</line>
            <line>Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:</line>
            <line>Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.</line>

            <line>Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone</line>

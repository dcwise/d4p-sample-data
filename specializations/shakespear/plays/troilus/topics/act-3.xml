            <line>I have strong reasons.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
            <line>But 'gainst your privacy</line>
            <line>The reasons are more potent and heroical:</line>
            <line>'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love</line>
            <line>With one of Priam's daughters.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

            <speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
            <line>Is that a wonder?</line>
            <line>The providence that's in a watchful state</line>
            <line>Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,</line>
            <line>Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,</line>
            <line>Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,</line>
            <line>Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.</line>
            <line>There is a mystery--with whom relation</line>
            <line>Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;</line>
            <line>Which hath an operation more divine</line>
            <line>Than breath or pen can give expressure to:</line>
            <line>All the commerce that you have had with Troy</line>
            <line>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;</line>
            <line>And better would it fit Achilles much</line>
            <line>To throw down Hector than Polyxena:</line>
            <line>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,</line>
            <line>When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,</line>
            <line>And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,</line>
            <line>'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,</line>
            <line>But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'</line>
            <line>Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;</line>
            <line>The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.</line>

            <line>To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:</line>
            <line>A woman impudent and mannish grown</line>
            <line>Is not more loathed than an effeminate man</line>
            <line>In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;</line>
            <line>They think my little stomach to the war</line>
            <line>And your great love to me restrains you thus:</line>
            <line>Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid</line>
            <line>Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,</line>
            <line>And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,</line>
            <line>Be shook to air.</line>

            <line>I see my reputation is at stake</line>

            <line>O, then, beware;</line>
            <line>Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:</line>
            <line>Omission to do what is necessary</line>
            <line>Seals a commission to a blank of danger;</line>
            <line>And danger, like an ague, subtly taints</line>

            <line>I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him</line>
            <line>To invite the Trojan lords after the combat</line>
            <line>To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,</line>
            <line>An appetite that I am sick withal,</line>
            <line>To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,</line>
            <line>To talk with him and to behold his visage,</line>
            <line>Even to my full of view.</line>

            <line>Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
            <line>He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so</line>
            <line>prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he</line>
            <line>raves in saying nothing.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
            <line>Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride</line>
            <line>and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no</line>
            <line>arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:</line>
            <line>bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should</line>
            <line>say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'</line>
            <line>and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire</line>
            <line>in a flint, which will not show without knocking.</line>
            <line>The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his</line>
            <line>neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in</line>
            <line>vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,</line>
            <line>Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think</line>
            <line>you of this man that takes me for the general? He's</line>
            <line>grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.</line>
            <line>A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both</line>
            <line>sides, like a leather jerkin.</line>

            <line>Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not</line>
            <line>answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his</line>
            <line>tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let</line>
            <line>Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the</line>
            <line>pageant of Ajax.</line>

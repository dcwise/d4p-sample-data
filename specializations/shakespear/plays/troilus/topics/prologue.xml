         <line>In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</line>
         <line>The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,</line>
         <line>Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,</line>
         <line>Fraught with the ministers and instruments</line>
         <line>Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore</line>
         <line>Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay</line>
         <line>Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made</line>
         <line>To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</line>
         <line>The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,</line>
         <line>With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.</line>
         <line>To Tenedos they come;</line>
         <line>And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</line>
         <line>Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains</line>
         <line>The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</line>
         <line>Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,</line>
         <line>Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,</line>
         <line>And Antenorides, with massy staples</line>
         <line>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,</line>
         <line>Sperr up the sons of Troy.</line>
         <line>Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,</line>
         <line>On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,</line>
         <line>Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come</line>
         <line>A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence</line>
         <line>Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited</line>
         <line>In like conditions as our argument,</line>
         <line>To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</line>
         <line>Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,</line>
         <line>Beginning in the middle, starting thence away</line>
         <line>To what may be digested in a play.</line>
         <line>Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:</line>
         <line>Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.</line>

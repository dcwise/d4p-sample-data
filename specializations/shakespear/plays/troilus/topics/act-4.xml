            <line>A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--</line>
            <line>Witness the process of your speech, wherein</line>
            <line>You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,</line>
            <line>Did haunt you in the field.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
            <line>Health to you, valiant sir,</line>
            <line>During all question of the gentle truce;</line>
            <line>But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance</line>

            <line>Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,</line>
            <line>Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,</line>

            <line>A thousand complete courses of the sun!</line>
            <line>But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,</line>

            <line>Not palating the taste of her dishonour,</line>
            <line>With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:</line>
            <line>He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up</line>
            <line>The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;</line>
            <line>You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins</line>
            <line>Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:</line>
            <line>Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;</line>

            <line>For every false drop in her bawdy veins</line>
            <line>A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple</line>
            <line>Of her contaminated carrion weight,</line>
            <line>A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,</line>
            <line>She hath not given so many good words breath</line>

            <line>Why, then will I no more:</line>
            <line>Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,</line>
            <line>A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;</line>
            <line>The obligation of our blood forbids</line>
            <line>A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:</line>
            <line>Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so</line>
            <line>That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,</line>
            <line>And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg</line>
            <line>All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood</line>
            <line>Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister</line>
            <line>Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,</line>
            <line>Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member</line>
            <line>Wherein my sword had not impressure made</line>
            <line>Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay</line>
            <line>That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,</line>
            <line>My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword</line>
            <line>Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:</line>
            <line>By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;</line>
            <line>Hector would have them fall upon him thus:</line>

            <line>Despising many forfeits and subduements,</line>

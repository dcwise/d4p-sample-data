            <line>Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that</line>
            <line>I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the</line>
            <line>wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with</line>
            <line>him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his</line>
            <line>company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one</line>
            <line>that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.</line>

            <line>No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the</line>
            <line>hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas</line>
            <line>as truly as a man of falsehood may.</line>

            <line>What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,</line>
            <line>I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old</line>
            <line>Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no</line>
            <line>starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou</line>
            <line>dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are</line>
            <line>content to do the profession some grace; that would,</line>
            <line>if matters should be looked into, for their own</line>
            <line>credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no</line>
            <line>foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,</line>
            <line>none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;</line>

            <line>strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than</line>
            <line>drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,</line>
            <line>I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the</line>
            <line>commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey</line>
            <line>on her, for they ride up and down on her and make</line>

            <line>O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.</line>
            <line>Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy</line>
            <line>time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though</line>
            <line>the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster</line>
            <line>it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the</line>
            <line>sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have</line>
            <line>partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,</line>
            <line>but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a</line>
            <line>foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant</line>
            <line>me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;</line>
            <line>why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall</line>
            <line>the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat</line>
            <line>blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall</line>
            <line>the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a</line>
            <line>question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,</line>
            <line>which thou hast often heard of and it is known to</line>
            <line>many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,</line>
            <line>as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth</line>
            <line>the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not</line>
            <line>speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in</line>
            <line>pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in</line>
            <line>woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I</line>
            <line>have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
            <line>What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a</line>
            <line>cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble</line>
            <line>carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,</line>
            <line>by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I</line>
            <line>remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man</line>
            <line>should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,</line>
            <line>I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be</line>
            <line>known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,</line>
            <line>peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that</line>
            <line>Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell</line>
            <line>me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast</line>
            <line>thou been this month?</line>

            <line>there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an</line>
            <line>old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why</line>
            <line>dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that</line>
            <line>bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel</line>
            <line>of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed</line>
            <line>cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with</line>

            <line>grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in</line>

            <line>drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a</line>
            <line>capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?</line>

            <line>But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,</line>
            <line>were to say more than I know. That he is old, the</line>

            <line>that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,</line>
            <line>that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,</line>
            <line>God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a</line>
            <line>sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if</line>
            <line>to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine</line>
            <line>are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,</line>

            <line>Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth</line>
            <line>In this fine age were not thought flattery,</line>
            <line>Such attribution should the Douglas have,</line>
            <line>As not a soldier of this season's stamp</line>
            <line>Should go so general current through the world.</line>
            <line>By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy</line>
            <line>The tongues of soothers; but a braver place</line>
            <line>In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:</line>

            <line>He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;</line>
            <line>And at the time of my departure thence</line>
            <line>He was much fear'd by his physicians.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>EARL OF WORCESTER</speaker>
            <line>I would the state of time had first been whole</line>

            <line>'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.</line>
            <line>He writes me here, that inward sickness--</line>
            <line>And that his friends by deputation could not</line>
            <line>So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet</line>
            <line>To lay so dangerous and dear a trust</line>
            <line>On any soul removed but on his own.</line>
            <line>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,</line>
            <line>That with our small conjunction we should on,</line>
            <line>To see how fortune is disposed to us;</line>
            <line>For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.</line>
            <line>Because the king is certainly possess'd</line>

            <line>A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:</line>
            <line>And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want</line>
            <line>Seems more than we shall find it: were it good</line>
            <line>To set the exact wealth of all our states</line>
            <line>All at one cast? to set so rich a main</line>
            <line>On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?</line>
            <line>It were not good; for therein should we read</line>

            <line>We may boldly spend upon the hope of what</line>

            <line>But yet I would your father had been here.</line>
            <line>The quality and hair of our attempt</line>
            <line>Brooks no division: it will be thought</line>
            <line>By some, that know not why he is away,</line>
            <line>That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike</line>
            <line>Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:</line>
            <line>And think how such an apprehension</line>
            <line>May turn the tide of fearful faction</line>
            <line>And breed a kind of question in our cause;</line>
            <line>For well you know we of the offering side</line>
            <line>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,</line>

            <line>The eye of reason may pry in upon us:</line>
            <line>This absence of your father's draws a curtain,</line>

            <line>It lends a lustre and more great opinion,</line>
            <line>A larger dare to our great enterprise,</line>
            <line>Than if the earl were here; for men must think,</line>

            <line>To push against a kingdom, with his help</line>
            <line>We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.</line>

            <line>Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,</line>
            <line>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</line>
            <line>My father gave him welcome to the shore;</line>
            <line>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</line>
            <line>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</line>
            <line>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</line>
            <line>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</line>
            <line>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</line>
            <line>Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.</line>
            <line>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</line>
            <line>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</line>
            <line>The more and less came in with cap and knee;</line>
            <line>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</line>
            <line>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</line>
            <line>Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,</line>
            <line>Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him</line>

            <line>And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:</line>
            <line>To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,</line>
            <line>Who is, if every owner were well placed,</line>
            <line>Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,</line>
            <line>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</line>
            <line>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</line>

            <line>Rated mine uncle from the council-board;</line>
            <line>In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;</line>
            <line>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</line>
            <line>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</line>

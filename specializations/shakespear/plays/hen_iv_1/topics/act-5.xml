            <line>As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,</line>

            <line>To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:</line>
            <line>This is not well, my lord, this is not well.</line>

            <line>It pleased your majesty to turn your looks</line>
            <line>Of favour from myself and all our house;</line>
            <line>And yet I must remember you, my lord,</line>
            <line>We were the first and dearest of your friends.</line>
            <line>For you my staff of office did I break</line>
            <line>In Richard's time; and posted day and night</line>
            <line>to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,</line>
            <line>When yet you were in place and in account</line>
            <line>Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.</line>
            <line>It was myself, my brother and his son,</line>
            <line>That brought you home and boldly did outdare</line>
            <line>The dangers of the time. You swore to us,</line>
            <line>And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,</line>
            <line>That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;</line>
            <line>Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,</line>
            <line>The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:</line>
            <line>To this we swore our aid. But in short space</line>
            <line>It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;</line>
            <line>And such a flood of greatness fell on you,</line>
            <line>What with our help, what with the absent king,</line>
            <line>What with the injuries of a wanton time,</line>
            <line>The seeming sufferances that you had borne,</line>
            <line>And the contrarious winds that held the king</line>
            <line>So long in his unlucky Irish wars</line>
            <line>That all in England did repute him dead:</line>
            <line>And from this swarm of fair advantages</line>
            <line>You took occasion to be quickly woo'd</line>
            <line>To gripe the general sway into your hand;</line>
            <line>Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;</line>
            <line>And being fed by us you used us so</line>
            <line>As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,</line>
            <line>Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;</line>
            <line>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk</line>
            <line>That even our love durst not come near your sight</line>
            <line>For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing</line>
            <line>We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly</line>
            <line>Out of sight and raise this present head;</line>
            <line>Whereby we stand opposed by such means</line>
            <line>As you yourself have forged against yourself</line>
            <line>By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,</line>
            <line>And violation of all faith and troth</line>
            <line>Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</line>

            <speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
            <line>These things indeed you have articulate,</line>
            <line>Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,</line>
            <line>To face the garment of rebellion</line>
            <line>With some fine colour that may please the eye</line>
            <line>Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,</line>
            <line>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news</line>
            <line>Of hurlyburly innovation:</line>
            <line>And never yet did insurrection want</line>
            <line>Such water-colours to impaint his cause;</line>
            <line>Nor moody beggars, starving for a time</line>
            <line>Of pellmell havoc and confusion.</line>

            <line>In both your armies there is many a soul</line>
            <line>Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,</line>
            <line>If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,</line>
            <line>The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world</line>
            <line>In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,</line>
            <line>This present enterprise set off his head,</line>
            <line>I do not think a braver gentleman,</line>
            <line>More active-valiant or more valiant-young,</line>
            <line>More daring or more bold, is now alive</line>
            <line>To grace this latter age with noble deeds.</line>
            <line>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,</line>
            <line>I have a truant been to chivalry;</line>
            <line>And so I hear he doth account me too;</line>
            <line>Yet this before my father's majesty--</line>
            <line>I am content that he shall take the odds</line>
            <line>Of his great name and estimation,</line>
            <line>And will, to save the blood on either side,</line>
            <line>Try fortune with him in a single fight.</line>

            <line>Albeit considerations infinite</line>
            <line>Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,</line>
            <line>We love our people well; even those we love</line>
            <line>That are misled upon your cousin's part;</line>

            <line>Both he and they and you, every man</line>
            <line>Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:</line>
            <line>So tell your cousin, and bring me word</line>

            <line>Rebuke and dread correction wait on us</line>
            <line>And they shall do their office. So, be gone;</line>
            <line>We will not now be troubled with reply:</line>

            <line>Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,</line>

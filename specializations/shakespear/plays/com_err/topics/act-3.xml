            <line>Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;</line>
            <line>My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:</line>
            <line>Say that I linger'd with you at your shop</line>
            <line>To see the making of her carcanet,</line>
            <line>And that to-morrow you will bring it home.</line>
            <line>But here's a villain that would face me down</line>
            <line>He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,</line>
            <line>And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,</line>
            <line>And that I did deny my wife and house.</line>
            <line>Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;</line>
            <line>That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:</line>
            <line>If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,</line>
            <line>Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.</line>

            <line>By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.</line>
            <line>I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,</line>
            <line>You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.</line>

            <line>Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.</line>

            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>And may it be that you have quite forgot</line>
            <line>A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.</line>
            <line>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?</line>
            <line>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</line>
            <line>If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</line>
            <line>Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:</line>
            <line>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;</line>
            <line>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</line>
            <line>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</line>
            <line>Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;</line>
            <line>Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;</line>
            <line>Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;</line>
            <line>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;</line>
            <line>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;</line>
            <line>Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?</line>
            <line>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</line>
            <line>'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed</line>
            <line>And let her read it in thy looks at board:</line>
            <line>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</line>
            <line>Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.</line>
            <line>Alas, poor women! make us but believe,</line>
            <line>Being compact of credit, that you love us;</line>
            <line>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;</line>
            <line>We in your motion turn and you may move us.</line>
            <line>Then, gentle brother, get you in again;</line>
            <line>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</line>
            <line>'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,</line>

            <line>Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,</line>
            <line>Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--</line>
            <line>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</line>
            <line>Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.</line>
            <line>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;</line>
            <line>Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,</line>
            <line>Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</line>
            <line>The folded meaning of your words' deceit.</line>
            <line>Against my soul's pure truth why labour you</line>
            <line>To make it wander in an unknown field?</line>
            <line>Are you a god? would you create me new?</line>
            <line>Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.</line>
            <line>But if that I am I, then well I know</line>
            <line>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</line>
            <line>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe</line>
            <line>Far more, far more to you do I decline.</line>
            <line>O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,</line>
            <line>To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:</line>
            <line>Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:</line>
            <line>Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</line>
            <line>And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,</line>
            <line>And in that glorious supposition think</line>
            <line>He gains by death that hath such means to die:</line>
            <line>Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</line>

            <line>What I should think of this, I cannot tell:</line>
            <line>But this I think, there's no man is so vain</line>
            <line>That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.</line>
            <line>I see a man here needs not live by shifts,</line>
            <line>When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.</line>
            <line>I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay</line>
            <line>If any ship put out, then straight away.</line>

            <speaker>Second Merchant</speaker>
            <line>You know since Pentecost the sum is due,</line>
            <line>And since I have not much importuned you;</line>
            <line>Nor now I had not, but that I am bound</line>
            <line>To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:</line>
            <line>Therefore make present satisfaction,</line>
            <line>Or I'll attach you by this officer.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>Even just the sum that I do owe to you</line>
            <line>Is growing to me by Antipholus,</line>
            <line>And in the instant that I met with you</line>
            <line>He had of me a chain: at five o'clock</line>
            <line>I shall receive the money for the same.</line>
            <line>Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,</line>
            <line>I will discharge my bond and thank you too.</line>

            <line>While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou</line>
            <line>And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow</line>
            <line>Among my wife and her confederates,</line>
            <line>For locking me out of my doors by day.</line>
            <line>But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;</line>
            <line>Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.</line>

            <line>A man is well holp up that trusts to you:</line>
            <line>I promised your presence and the chain;</line>
            <line>But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.</line>
            <line>Belike you thought our love would last too long,</line>
            <line>If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.</line>

            <line>Saving your merry humour, here's the note</line>
            <line>How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,</line>
            <line>The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.</line>
            <line>Which doth amount to three odd ducats more</line>
            <line>Than I stand debted to this gentleman:</line>
            <line>I pray you, see him presently discharged,</line>
            <line>For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.</line>

            <line>Good signior, take the stranger to my house</line>
            <line>And with you take the chain and bid my wife</line>
            <line>Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:</line>
            <line>Perchance I will be there as soon as you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:</line>
            <line>Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,</line>
            <line>And I, to blame, have held him here too long.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse</line>
            <line>Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.</line>
            <line>I should have chid you for not bringing it,</line>
            <line>But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.</line>
            <line>Either send the chain or send me by some token.</line>

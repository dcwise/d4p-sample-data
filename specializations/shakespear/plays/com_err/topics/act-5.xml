            <line>I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;</line>
            <line>But, I protest, he had the chain of me,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>Of very reverend reputation, sir,</line>
            <line>Of credit infinite, highly beloved,</line>
            <line>Second to none that lives here in the city:</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck</line>
            <line>Which he forswore most monstrously to have.</line>
            <line>Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.</line>
            <line>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much</line>
            <line>That you would put me to this shame and trouble;</line>
            <line>And, not without some scandal to yourself,</line>
            <line>With circumstance and oaths so to deny</line>
            <line>This chain which now you wear so openly:</line>
            <line>Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,</line>
            <line>You have done wrong to this my honest friend,</line>
            <line>Who, but for staying on our controversy,</line>
            <line>Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:</line>
            <line>This chain you had of me; can you deny it?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</speaker>
            <line>I think I had; I never did deny it.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Merchant</speaker>
            <line>Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.</line>

            <line>These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.</line>
            <line>Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest</line>
            <line>To walk where any honest man resort.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</speaker>
            <line>Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:</line>

            <line>Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.</line>

            <line>Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.</line>
            <line>Some get within him, take his sword away:</line>

            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.</line>
            <line>Let us come in, that we may bind him fast</line>
            <line>And bear him home for his recovery.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANGELO</speaker>
            <line>I knew he was not in his perfect wits.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Merchant</speaker>
            <line>I am sorry now that I did draw on him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>How long hath this possession held the man?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,</line>
            <line>And much different from the man he was;</line>
            <line>But till this afternoon his passion</line>
            <line>Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?</line>
            <line>Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye</line>
            <line>Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?</line>
            <line>A sin prevailing much in youthful men,</line>
            <line>Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.</line>
            <line>Which of these sorrows is he subject to?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>To none of these, except it be the last;</line>
            <line>Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>You should for that have reprehended him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Why, so I did.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but not rough enough.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>As roughly as my modesty would let me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>Haply, in private.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>And in assemblies too.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>Ay, but not enough.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>It was the copy of our conference:</line>
            <line>In bed he slept not for my urging it;</line>
            <line>At board he fed not for my urging it;</line>
            <line>Alone, it was the subject of my theme;</line>
            <line>In company I often glanced it;</line>
            <line>Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>And thereof came it that the man was mad.</line>
            <line>The venom clamours of a jealous woman</line>
            <line>Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.</line>
            <line>It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,</line>
            <line>And therefore comes it that his head is light.</line>
            <line>Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:</line>
            <line>Unquiet meals make ill digestions;</line>
            <line>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;</line>
            <line>And what's a fever but a fit of madness?</line>
            <line>Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:</line>
            <line>Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue</line>
            <line>But moody and dull melancholy,</line>
            <line>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,</line>
            <line>And at her heels a huge infectious troop</line>
            <line>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?</line>
            <line>In food, in sport and life-preserving rest</line>
            <line>To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:</line>
            <line>The consequence is then thy jealous fits</line>
            <line>Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>She never reprehended him but mildly,</line>
            <line>When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.</line>
            <line>Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>She did betray me to my own reproof.</line>
            <line>Good people enter and lay hold on him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>No, not a creature enters in my house.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Then let your servants bring my husband forth.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,</line>
            <line>And it shall privilege him from your hands</line>
            <line>Till I have brought him to his wits again,</line>
            <line>Or lose my labour in assaying it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>I will attend my husband, be his nurse,</line>
            <line>Diet his sickness, for it is my office,</line>
            <line>And will have no attorney but myself;</line>
            <line>And therefore let me have him home with me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>Be patient; for I will not let him stir</line>
            <line>Till I have used the approved means I have,</line>
            <line>With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,</line>
            <line>To make of him a formal man again:</line>
            <line>It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,</line>
            <line>A charitable duty of my order.</line>
            <line>Therefore depart and leave him here with me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>I will not hence and leave my husband here:</line>
            <line>And ill it doth beseem your holiness</line>
            <line>To separate the husband and the wife.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>AEMELIA</speaker>
            <line>Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.</line>

            <line>Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet</line>
            <line>And never rise until my tears and prayers</line>
            <line>Have won his grace to come in person hither</line>
            <line>And take perforce my husband from the abbess.</line>

            <speaker>Second Merchant</speaker>
            <line>By this, I think, the dial points at five:</line>
            <line>Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person</line>
            <line>Comes this way to the melancholy vale,</line>
            <line>The place of death and sorry execution,</line>
            <line>Behind the ditches of the abbey here.</line>
         </speech>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Merchant</speaker>
            <line>To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,</line>
            <line>Who put unluckily into this bay</line>
            <line>Against the laws and statutes of this town,</line>
            <line>Beheaded publicly for his offence.</line>

            <line>May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,</line>
            <line>Whom I made lord of me and all I had,</line>
            <line>At your important letters,--this ill day</line>
            <line>A most outrageous fit of madness took him;</line>
            <line>That desperately he hurried through the street,</line>
            <line>With him his bondman, all as mad as he--</line>
            <line>Doing displeasure to the citizens</line>
            <line>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence</line>
            <line>Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.</line>
            <line>Once did I get him bound and sent him home,</line>
            <line>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,</line>
            <line>That here and there his fury had committed.</line>
            <line>Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,</line>
            <line>He broke from those that had the guard of him;</line>
            <line>And with his mad attendant and himself,</line>
            <line>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</line>
            <line>Met us again and madly bent on us,</line>
            <line>Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,</line>
            <line>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</line>
            <line>Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:</line>
            <line>And here the abbess shuts the gates on us</line>
            <line>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,</line>
            <line>Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.</line>
            <line>Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command</line>
            <line>Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.</line>

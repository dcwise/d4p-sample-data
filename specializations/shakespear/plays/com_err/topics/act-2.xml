         <stagedir>Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,</line>
            <line>That in such haste I sent to seek his master!</line>
            <line>Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,</line>
            <line>And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.</line>
            <line>Good sister, let us dine and never fret:</line>
            <line>A man is master of his liberty:</line>
            <line>Time is their master, and, when they see time,</line>
            <line>They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Why should their liberty than ours be more?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Because their business still lies out o' door.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>O, know he is the bridle of your will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>There's none but asses will be bridled so.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.</line>
            <line>There's nothing situate under heaven's eye</line>
            <line>But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:</line>
            <line>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,</line>
            <line>Are their males' subjects and at their controls:</line>
            <line>Men, more divine, the masters of all these,</line>
            <line>Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,</line>
            <line>Indued with intellectual sense and souls,</line>
            <line>Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,</line>
            <line>Are masters to their females, and their lords:</line>
            <line>Then let your will attend on their accords.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>This servitude makes you to keep unwed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>How if your husband start some other where?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Till he come home again, I would forbear.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;</line>
            <line>They can be meek that have no other cause.</line>
            <line>A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,</line>
            <line>We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;</line>
            <line>But were we burdened with like weight of pain,</line>
            <line>As much or more would we ourselves complain:</line>
            <line>So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,</line>
            <line>With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,</line>
            <line>But, if thou live to see like right bereft,</line>
            <line>This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Well, I will marry one day, but to try.</line>
            <line>Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Say, is your tardy master now at hand?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears</line>
            <line>can witness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:</line>
            <line>Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his</line>
            <line>blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce</line>
            <line>understand them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he</line>
            <line>hath great care to please his wife.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Horn-mad, thou villain!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>I mean not cuckold-mad;</line>
            <line>But, sure, he is stark mad.</line>
            <line>When I desired him to come home to dinner,</line>
            <line>He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:</line>
            <line>''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;</line>
            <line>'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:</line>
            <line>'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.</line>
            <line>'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'</line>
            <line>'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:</line>
            <line>'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!</line>
            <line>I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>Quoth who?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Quoth my master:</line>
            <line>'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'</line>
            <line>So that my errand, due unto my tongue,</line>
            <line>I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;</line>
            <line>For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Go back again, and be new beaten home?</line>
            <line>For God's sake, send some other messenger.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>And he will bless that cross with other beating:</line>
            <line>Between you I shall have a holy head.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</speaker>
            <line>Am I so round with you as you with me,</line>
            <line>That like a football you do spurn me thus?</line>
            <line>You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:</line>
            <line>If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.</line>

         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>

            <line>Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>His company must do his minions grace,</line>
            <line>Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.</line>
            <line>Hath homely age the alluring beauty took</line>
            <line>From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:</line>
            <line>Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?</line>
            <line>If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,</line>
            <line>Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:</line>
            <line>Do their gay vestments his affections bait?</line>
            <line>That's not my fault: he's master of my state:</line>
            <line>What ruins are in me that can be found,</line>
            <line>By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground</line>
            <line>Of my defeatures. My decayed fair</line>
            <line>A sunny look of his would soon repair</line>
            <line>But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale</line>
            <line>And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIANA</speaker>
            <line>Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ADRIANA</speaker>
            <line>Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.</line>
            <line>I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,</line>
            <line>Or else what lets it but he would be here?</line>
            <line>Sister, you know he promised me a chain;</line>
            <line>Would that alone, alone he would detain,</line>
            <line>So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!</line>
            <line>I see the jewel best enamelled</line>
            <line>Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,</line>
            <line>That others touch, and often touching will</line>
            <line>Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,</line>
            <line>By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.</line>
            <line>Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,</line>
            <line>I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
            <line>This way the king will come; this is the way</line>
            <line>To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,</line>
            <line>To whose flint bosom my condemned lord</line>
            <line>Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:</line>
            <line>Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth</line>
            <line>Have any resting for her true king's queen.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard</stagedir>
            <line>But soft, but see, or rather do not see,</line>
            <line>My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,</line>
            <line>That you in pity may dissolve to dew,</line>
            <line>And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.</line>
            <line>Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,</line>
            <line>Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,</line>
            <line>And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,</line>
            <line>Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,</line>
            <line>When triumph is become an alehouse guest?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,</line>
            <line>To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,</line>
            <line>To think our former state a happy dream;</line>
            <line>From which awaked, the truth of what we are</line>
            <line>Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,</line>
            <line>To grim Necessity, and he and I</line>
            <line>Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France</line>
            <line>And cloister thee in some religious house:</line>
            <line>Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,</line>
            <line>Which our profane hours here have stricken down.</line>

            <line>What, is my Richard both in shape and mind</line>
            <line>Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed</line>
            <line>Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?</line>
            <line>The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,</line>
            <line>And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage</line>
            <line>To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,</line>
            <line>Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,</line>
            <line>And fawn on rage with base humility,</line>
            <line>Which art a lion and a king of beasts?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,</line>
            <line>I had been still a happy king of men.</line>
            <line>Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:</line>
            <line>Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,</line>
            <line>As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.</line>
            <line>In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire</line>
            <line>With good old folks and let them tell thee tales</line>
            <line>Of woeful ages long ago betid;</line>
            <line>And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,</line>
            <line>Tell thou the lamentable tale of me</line>
            <line>And send the hearers weeping to their beds:</line>
            <line>For why, the senseless brands will sympathize</line>
            <line>The heavy accent of thy moving tongue</line>
            <line>And in compassion weep the fire out;</line>
            <line>And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,</line>
            <line>For the deposing of a rightful king.</line>

         <stagedir>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:</line>
            <line>You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.</line>
            <line>And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;</line>
            <line>With all swift speed you must away to France.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal</line>
            <line>The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,</line>
            <line>The time shall not be many hours of age</line>
            <line>More than it is ere foul sin gathering head</line>
            <line>Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,</line>
            <line>Though he divide the realm and give thee half,</line>
            <line>It is too little, helping him to all;</line>
            <line>And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way</line>
            <line>To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,</line>
            <line>Being ne'er so little urged, another way</line>
            <line>To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.</line>
            <line>The love of wicked men converts to fear;</line>
            <line>That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both</line>
            <line>To worthy danger and deserved death.</line>

            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate</line>
            <line>A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,</line>
            <line>And then betwixt me and my married wife.</line>
            <line>Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;</line>
            <line>And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.</line>
            <line>Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,</line>
            <line>Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;</line>
            <line>My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,</line>
            <line>She came adorned hither like sweet May,</line>
            <line>Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
            <line>And must we be divided? must we part?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>So two, together weeping, make one woe.</line>
            <line>Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;</line>
            <line>Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.</line>
            <line>Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
            <line>So longest way shall have the longest moans.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,</line>
            <line>And piece the way out with a heavy heart.</line>
            <line>Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,</line>
            <line>Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;</line>
            <line>One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;</line>
            <line>Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
            <line>Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part</line>
            <line>To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.</line>
            <line>So, now I have mine own again, be gone,</line>
            <line>That I might strive to kill it with a groan.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>We make woe wanton with this fond delay:</line>

            <line>Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,</line>
            <line>Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed</line>

            <line>Upon his visage, and that all the walls</line>

            <line>Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes</line>

            <line>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:</line>

            <line>His face still combating with tears and smiles,</line>
            <line>The badges of his grief and patience,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>I have been studying how I may compare</line>
            <line>This prison where I live unto the world:</line>
            <line>And for because the world is populous</line>
            <line>And here is not a creature but myself,</line>
            <line>I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.</line>
            <line>My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,</line>
            <line>My soul the father; and these two beget</line>
            <line>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</line>
            <line>And these same thoughts people this little world,</line>
            <line>In humours like the people of this world,</line>
            <line>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</line>
            <line>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd</line>
            <line>With scruples and do set the word itself</line>
            <line>Against the word:</line>
            <line>As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,</line>
            <line>'It is as hard to come as for a camel</line>
            <line>To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'</line>
            <line>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</line>
            <line>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</line>
            <line>May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</line>
            <line>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</line>
            <line>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</line>
            <line>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</line>
            <line>That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,</line>
            <line>Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</line>
            <line>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</line>
            <line>That many have and others must sit there;</line>
            <line>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</line>
            <line>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</line>
            <line>Of such as have before endured the like.</line>
            <line>Thus play I in one person many people,</line>
            <line>And none contented: sometimes am I king;</line>
            <line>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</line>
            <line>And so I am: then crushing penury</line>
            <line>Persuades me I was better when a king;</line>
            <line>Then am I king'd again: and by and by</line>
            <line>Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,</line>
            <line>And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,</line>
            <line>Nor I nor any man that but man is</line>
            <line>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</line>

            <line>So is it in the music of men's lives.</line>
            <line>And here have I the daintiness of ear</line>
            <line>To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;</line>
            <line>But for the concord of my state and time</line>
            <line>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</line>
            <line>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</line>
            <line>For now hath time made me his numbering clock:</line>
            <line>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</line>
            <line>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</line>
            <line>Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</line>
            <line>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</line>
            <line>Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</line>
            <line>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</line>
            <line>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</line>
            <line>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</line>
            <line>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</line>
            <line>While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.</line>
            <line>This music mads me; let it sound no more;</line>
            <line>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</line>
            <line>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</line>
            <line>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</line>
            <line>For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</line>
            <line>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</line>

            <line>Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,</line>

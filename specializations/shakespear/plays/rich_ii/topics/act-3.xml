            <line>Bring forth these men.</line>
            <line>Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--</line>
            <line>Since presently your souls must part your bodies--</line>
            <line>With too much urging your pernicious lives,</line>
            <line>For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood</line>
            <line>From off my hands, here in the view of men</line>
            <line>I will unfold some causes of your deaths.</line>
            <line>You have misled a prince, a royal king,</line>
            <line>A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,</line>
            <line>By you unhappied and disfigured clean:</line>
            <line>You have in manner with your sinful hours</line>
            <line>Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,</line>
            <line>Broke the possession of a royal bed</line>
            <line>And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks</line>
            <line>With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.</line>
            <line>Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,</line>
            <line>Near to the king in blood, and near in love</line>
            <line>Till you did make him misinterpret me,</line>
            <line>Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,</line>
            <line>And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,</line>
            <line>Eating the bitter bread of banishment;</line>
            <line>Whilst you have fed upon my signories,</line>
            <line>Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,</line>
            <line>From my own windows torn my household coat,</line>
            <line>Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,</line>
            <line>Save men's opinions and my living blood,</line>
            <line>To show the world I am a gentleman.</line>
            <line>This and much more, much more than twice all this,</line>
            <line>Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over</line>
            <line>To execution and the hand of death.</line>

            <line>Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;</line>

            <line>Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy</line>

            <line>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</line>
            <line>Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:</line>
            <line>As a long-parted mother with her child</line>
            <line>Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,</line>
            <line>So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</line>

            <line>Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,</line>
            <line>Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;</line>
            <line>But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,</line>
            <line>And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,</line>
            <line>Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet</line>
            <line>Which with usurping steps do trample thee:</line>

            <line>Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:</line>

            <line>The means that heaven yields must be embraced,</line>

            <line>Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not</line>
            <line>That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,</line>
            <line>Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,</line>
            <line>Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen</line>
            <line>In murders and in outrage, boldly here;</line>
            <line>But when from under this terrestrial ball</line>
            <line>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</line>
            <line>And darts his light through every guilty hole,</line>
            <line>Then murders, treasons and detested sins,</line>
            <line>The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,</line>
            <line>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</line>
            <line>So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,</line>
            <line>Who all this while hath revell'd in the night</line>
            <line>Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,</line>
            <line>Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</line>
            <line>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</line>
            <line>Not able to endure the sight of day,</line>
            <line>But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.</line>
            <line>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</line>
            <line>Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;</line>
            <line>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</line>
            <line>The deputy elected by the Lord:</line>

            <line>God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</line>

            <line>Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;</line>
            <line>The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.</line>
            <line>Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care</line>
            <line>And what loss is it to be rid of care?</line>
            <line>Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?</line>
            <line>Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,</line>

            <line>Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;</line>
            <line>They break their faith to God as well as us:</line>
            <line>Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:</line>

            <line>With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.</line>
            <line>White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps</line>
            <line>Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,</line>
            <line>Strive to speak big and clap their female joints</line>
            <line>In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:</line>

            <line>My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,</line>
            <line>But presently prevent the ways to wail.</line>
            <line>To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,</line>
            <line>Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,</line>
            <line>And so your follies fight against yourself.</line>
            <line>Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:</line>
            <line>And fight and die is death destroying death;</line>
            <line>Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</line>

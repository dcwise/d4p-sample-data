         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,</line>
            <line>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</line>
            <line>Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,</line>
            <line>Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,</line>
            <line>Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</line>
            <line>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
            <line>I have, my liege.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</line>
            <line>If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;</line>
            <line>Or worthily, as a good subject should,</line>
            <line>On some known ground of treachery in him?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JOHN OF GAUNT</speaker>
            <line>As near as I could sift him on that argument,</line>
            <line>On some apparent danger seen in him</line>
            <line>Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Then call them to our presence; face to face,</line>
            <line>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</line>
            <line>The accuser and the accused freely speak:</line>
            <line>High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,</line>
            <line>In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</line>

            <speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
            <line>Many years of happy days befal</line>
            <line>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</line>

            <speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>Each day still better other's happiness;</line>
            <line>Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,</line>
            <line>Add an immortal title to your crown!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,</line>
            <line>As well appeareth by the cause you come;</line>
            <line>Namely to appeal each other of high treason.</line>
            <line>Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object</line>
            <line>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
            <line>First, heaven be the record to my speech!</line>
            <line>In the devotion of a subject's love,</line>
            <line>Tendering the precious safety of my prince,</line>
            <line>And free from other misbegotten hate,</line>
            <line>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</line>
            <line>Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</line>
            <line>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</line>
            <line>My body shall make good upon this earth,</line>
            <line>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</line>
            <line>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</line>
            <line>Too good to be so and too bad to live,</line>
            <line>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</line>
            <line>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</line>
            <line>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</line>
            <line>With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;</line>
            <line>And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,</line>
            <line>What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:</line>
            <line>'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,</line>
            <line>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</line>
            <line>Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</line>
            <line>The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:</line>
            <line>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</line>
            <line>As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:</line>
            <line>First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me</line>
            <line>From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;</line>
            <line>Which else would post until it had return'd</line>
            <line>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</line>
            <line>Setting aside his high blood's royalty,</line>
            <line>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</line>
            <line>I do defy him, and I spit at him;</line>
            <line>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:</line>
            <line>Which to maintain I would allow him odds,</line>
            <line>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</line>
            <line>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</line>
            <line>Or any other ground inhabitable,</line>
            <line>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</line>
            <line>Mean time let this defend my loyalty,</line>
            <line>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
            <line>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</line>
            <line>Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,</line>
            <line>And lay aside my high blood's royalty,</line>
            <line>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</line>
            <line>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</line>
            <line>As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:</line>
            <line>By that and all the rites of knighthood else,</line>
            <line>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</line>
            <line>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>I take it up; and by that sword I swear</line>
            <line>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</line>
            <line>I'll answer thee in any fair degree,</line>
            <line>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:</line>
            <line>And when I mount, alive may I not light,</line>
            <line>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?</line>
            <line>It must be great that can inherit us</line>
            <line>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
            <line>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;</line>
            <line>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</line>
            <line>In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,</line>
            <line>The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,</line>
            <line>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</line>
            <line>Besides I say and will in battle prove,</line>
            <line>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</line>
            <line>That ever was survey'd by English eye,</line>
            <line>That all the treasons for these eighteen years</line>
            <line>Complotted and contrived in this land</line>
            <line>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</line>
            <line>Further I say and further will maintain</line>
            <line>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</line>
            <line>That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,</line>
            <line>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</line>
            <line>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</line>
            <line>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</line>
            <line>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,</line>
            <line>Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</line>
            <line>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</line>
            <line>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</line>
            <line>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>How high a pitch his resolution soars!</line>
            <line>Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>O, let my sovereign turn away his face</line>
            <line>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</line>
            <line>Till I have told this slander of his blood,</line>
            <line>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:</line>
            <line>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,</line>
            <line>As he is but my father's brother's son,</line>
            <line>Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,</line>
            <line>Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood</line>
            <line>Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize</line>
            <line>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:</line>
            <line>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:</line>
            <line>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THOMAS MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</line>
            <line>Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</line>
            <line>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</line>
            <line>Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;</line>
            <line>The other part reserved I by consent,</line>
            <line>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</line>
            <line>Upon remainder of a dear account,</line>
            <line>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</line>
            <line>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,</line>
            <line>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace</line>
            <line>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</line>
            <line>For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</line>
            <line>The honourable father to my foe</line>
            <line>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</line>
            <line>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul</line>
            <line>But ere I last received the sacrament</line>
            <line>I did confess it, and exactly begg'd</line>
            <line>Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.</line>
            <line>This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,</line>
            <line>It issues from the rancour of a villain,</line>
            <line>A recreant and most degenerate traitor</line>
            <line>Which in myself I boldly will defend;</line>
            <line>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</line>
            <line>Upon this overweening traitor's foot,</line>
            <line>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</line>
            <line>Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.</line>
            <line>In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</line>
            <line>Your highness to assign our trial day.</line>

            <line>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;</line>
            <line>Let's purge this choler without letting blood:</line>
            <line>This we prescribe, though no physician;</line>
            <line>Deep malice makes too deep incision;</line>
            <line>Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;</line>
            <line>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</line>
            <line>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</line>
            <line>We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</line>

            <line>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</line>
            <line>The one my duty owes; but my fair name,</line>
            <line>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</line>
            <line>To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.</line>
            <line>I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,</line>
            <line>Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,</line>

            <line>Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.</line>

            <line>The purest treasure mortal times afford</line>

            <line>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</line>
            <line>A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest</line>

            <line>Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:</line>

            <line>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</line>

            <line>Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,</line>
            <line>By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.</line>
            <line>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,</line>
            <line>That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee</line>
            <line>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</line>
            <line>Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent</line>
            <line>In some large measure to thy father's death,</line>
            <line>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</line>
            <line>Who was the model of thy father's life.</line>
            <line>Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:</line>
            <line>In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,</line>
            <line>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</line>
            <line>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:</line>
            <line>That which in mean men we intitle patience</line>
            <line>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</line>
            <line>What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,</line>

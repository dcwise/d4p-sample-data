            <speaker>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</speaker>
            <line>Call forth Bagot.</line>
            <line>Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;</line>
            <line>What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,</line>
            <line>Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd</line>

            <line>My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue</line>
            <line>Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.</line>
            <line>In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,</line>
            <line>I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,</line>
            <line>That reacheth from the restful English court</line>
            <line>As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'</line>
            <line>Amongst much other talk, that very time,</line>
            <line>I heard you say that you had rather refuse</line>
            <line>The offer of an hundred thousand crowns</line>
            <line>Than Bolingbroke's return to England;</line>
            <line>Adding withal how blest this land would be</line>
            <line>In this your cousin's death.</line>

            <line>Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,</line>
            <line>On equal terms to give him chastisement?</line>
            <line>Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd</line>
            <line>With the attainder of his slanderous lips.</line>
            <line>There is my gage, the manual seal of death,</line>
            <line>That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,</line>
            <line>And will maintain what thou hast said is false</line>
            <line>In thy heart-blood, though being all too base</line>

            <line>By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,</line>
            <line>I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it</line>
            <line>That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.</line>
            <line>If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;</line>

            <line>Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would</line>

            <line>What subject can give sentence on his king?</line>
            <line>And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?</line>
            <line>Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,</line>
            <line>Although apparent guilt be seen in them;</line>

            <line>I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,</line>
            <line>Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:</line>
            <line>My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,</line>
            <line>Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:</line>
            <line>And if you crown him, let me prophesy:</line>
            <line>The blood of English shall manure the ground,</line>

            <line>Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,</line>

            <line>Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;</line>
            <line>Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.</line>
            <line>Now mark me, how I will undo myself;</line>
            <line>I give this heavy weight from off my head</line>
            <line>And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,</line>
            <line>The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;</line>
            <line>With mine own tears I wash away my balm,</line>
            <line>With mine own hands I give away my crown,</line>
            <line>With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,</line>
            <line>With mine own breath release all duty's rites:</line>
            <line>All pomp and majesty I do forswear;</line>
            <line>My manors, rents, revenues I forego;</line>
            <line>My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:</line>
            <line>God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!</line>
            <line>God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!</line>
            <line>Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,</line>
            <line>And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!</line>
            <line>Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,</line>
            <line>And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!</line>
            <line>God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,</line>
            <line>And send him many years of sunshine days!</line>
            <line>What more remains?</line>

            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>No more, but that you read</line>
            <line>These accusations and these grievous crimes</line>
            <line>Committed by your person and your followers</line>
            <line>Against the state and profit of this land;</line>
            <line>That, by confessing them, the souls of men</line>

            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>Must I do so? and must I ravel out</line>
            <line>My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,</line>
            <line>If thy offences were upon record,</line>
            <line>Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop</line>
            <line>To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,</line>
            <line>There shouldst thou find one heinous article,</line>
            <line>Containing the deposing of a king</line>
            <line>And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,</line>
            <line>Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:</line>
            <line>Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,</line>
            <line>Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,</line>
            <line>Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands</line>
            <line>Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates</line>
            <line>Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,</line>
            <line>And water cannot wash away your sin.</line>

            <line>Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:</line>
            <line>And yet salt water blinds them not so much</line>
            <line>But they can see a sort of traitors here.</line>
            <line>Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,</line>
            <line>I find myself a traitor with the rest;</line>
            <line>For I have given here my soul's consent</line>
            <line>To undeck the pompous body of a king;</line>
            <line>Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,</line>
            <line>Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.</line>

            <line>No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,</line>
            <line>Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,</line>
            <line>No, not that name was given me at the font,</line>
            <line>But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,</line>
            <line>That I have worn so many winters out,</line>
            <line>And know not now what name to call myself!</line>
            <line>O that I were a mockery king of snow,</line>
            <line>Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,</line>
            <line>To melt myself away in water-drops!</line>
            <line>Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,</line>
            <line>An if my word be sterling yet in England,</line>
            <line>Let it command a mirror hither straight,</line>
            <line>That it may show me what a face I have,</line>
            <line>Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.</line>

            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,</line>
            <line>When I do see the very book indeed</line>
            <line>Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.</line>
            <stagedir>Re-enter Attendant, with a glass</stagedir>
            <line>Give me the glass, and therein will I read.</line>
            <line>No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck</line>
            <line>So many blows upon this face of mine,</line>
            <line>And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,</line>
            <line>Like to my followers in prosperity,</line>
            <line>Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face</line>
            <line>That every day under his household roof</line>
            <line>Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face</line>
            <line>That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?</line>
            <line>Was this the face that faced so many follies,</line>
            <line>And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?</line>
            <line>A brittle glory shineth in this face:</line>
            <line>As brittle as the glory is the face;</line>
            <stagedir>Dashes the glass against the ground</stagedir>
            <line>For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.</line>
            <line>Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,</line>
            <line>How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.</line>

            <line>Say that again.</line>
            <line>The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:</line>
            <line>'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;</line>
            <line>And these external manners of laments</line>
            <line>Are merely shadows to the unseen grief</line>
            <line>That swells with silence in the tortured soul;</line>
            <line>There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,</line>
            <line>For thy great bounty, that not only givest</line>
            <line>Me cause to wail but teachest me the way</line>
            <line>How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,</line>
            <line>And then be gone and trouble you no more.</line>
            <line>Shall I obtain it?</line>

            <speaker>KING RICHARD II</speaker>
            <line>'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:</line>
            <line>For when I was a king, my flatterers</line>
            <line>Were then but subjects; being now a subject,</line>
            <line>I have a king here to my flatterer.</line>

      <scene-body>
         <stagedir>Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and
Attendants</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HIPPOLYTA</speaker>
            <line>'Tis strange my Theseus, that these</line>
            <line>lovers speak of.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
            <line>More strange than true: I never may believe</line>
            <line>These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.</line>
            <line>Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</line>
            <line>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</line>
            <line>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</line>
            <line>The lunatic, the lover and the poet</line>
            <line>Are of imagination all compact:</line>
            <line>One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,</line>
            <line>That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,</line>
            <line>Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:</line>
            <line>The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,</line>
            <line>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</line>
            <line>And as imagination bodies forth</line>
            <line>The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen</line>
            <line>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</line>
            <line>A local habitation and a name.</line>
            <line>Such tricks hath strong imagination,</line>
            <line>That if it would but apprehend some joy,</line>
            <line>It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</line>
            <line>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</line>
            <line>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>But all the story of the night told over,</line>
            <line>And all their minds transfigured so together,</line>
            <line>More witnesseth than fancy's images</line>
            <line>And grows to something of great constancy;</line>
            <line>But, howsoever, strange and admirable.</line>

            <line>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;</line>
            <line>But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.</line>
            <line>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</line>
            <line>This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.</line>
            <line>This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present</line>
            <line>Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;</line>
            <line>And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content</line>
            <line>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.</line>
            <line>This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,</line>
            <line>Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,</line>
            <line>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</line>
            <line>To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.</line>
            <line>This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,</line>
            <line>The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,</line>
            <line>Did scare away, or rather did affright;</line>
            <line>And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</line>
            <line>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</line>
            <line>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</line>
            <line>And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:</line>
            <line>Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</line>
            <line>He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;</line>
            <line>And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,</line>
            <line>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</line>
            <line>Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain</line>

            <line>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,</line>
            <line>Did whisper often very secretly.</line>
            <line>This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show</line>

            <line>Now are frolic: not a mouse</line>
            <line>Shall disturb this hallow'd house:</line>
            <line>I am sent with broom before,</line>
            <line>To sweep the dust behind the door.</line>

            <line>Through the house give gathering light,</line>
            <line>By the dead and drowsy fire:</line>
            <line>Every elf and fairy sprite</line>
            <line>Hop as light as bird from brier;</line>
            <line>And this ditty, after me,</line>
            <line>Sing, and dance it trippingly.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
            <line>First, rehearse your song by rote</line>
            <line>To each word a warbling note:</line>
            <line>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,</line>
            <line>Will we sing, and bless this place.</line>

            <line>Now, until the break of day,</line>
            <line>Through this house each fairy stray.</line>
            <line>To the best bride-bed will we,</line>
            <line>Which by us shall blessed be;</line>
            <line>And the issue there create</line>
            <line>Ever shall be fortunate.</line>
            <line>So shall all the couples three</line>
            <line>Ever true in loving be;</line>
            <line>And the blots of Nature's hand</line>
            <line>Shall not in their issue stand;</line>
            <line>Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,</line>
            <line>Nor mark prodigious, such as are</line>
            <line>Despised in nativity,</line>
            <line>Shall upon their children be.</line>
            <line>With this field-dew consecrate,</line>
            <line>Every fairy take his gait;</line>
            <line>And each several chamber bless,</line>
            <line>Through this palace, with sweet peace;</line>
            <line>And the owner of it blest</line>
            <line>Ever shall in safety rest.</line>
            <line>Trip away; make no stay;</line>
            <line>Meet me all by break of day.</line>

            <line>If we shadows have offended,</line>
            <line>Think but this, and all is mended,</line>
            <line>That you have but slumber'd here</line>
            <line>While these visions did appear.</line>
            <line>And this weak and idle theme,</line>
            <line>No more yielding but a dream,</line>
            <line>Gentles, do not reprehend:</line>
            <line>if you pardon, we will mend:</line>
            <line>And, as I am an honest Puck,</line>
            <line>If we have unearned luck</line>
            <line>Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,</line>
            <line>We will make amends ere long;</line>
            <line>Else the Puck a liar call;</line>
            <line>So, good night unto you all.</line>
            <line>Give me your hands, if we be friends,</line>
            <line>And Robin shall restore amends.</line>

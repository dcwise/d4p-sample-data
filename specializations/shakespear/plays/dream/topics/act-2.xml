            <speaker>PUCK</speaker>
            <line>How now, spirit! whither wander you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Fairy</speaker>
            <line>Over hill, over dale,</line>
            <line>Thorough bush, thorough brier,</line>
            <line>Over park, over pale,</line>
            <line>Thorough flood, thorough fire,</line>
            <line>I do wander everywhere,</line>
            <line>Swifter than the moon's sphere;</line>
            <line>And I serve the fairy queen,</line>
            <line>To dew her orbs upon the green.</line>
            <line>The cowslips tall her pensioners be:</line>
            <line>In their gold coats spots you see;</line>
            <line>Those be rubies, fairy favours,</line>
            <line>In those freckles live their savours:</line>
            <line>I must go seek some dewdrops here</line>
            <line>And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.</line>
            <line>Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:</line>
            <line>Our queen and all our elves come here anon.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PUCK</speaker>
            <line>The king doth keep his revels here to-night:</line>
            <line>Take heed the queen come not within his sight;</line>
            <line>For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</line>
            <line>Because that she as her attendant hath</line>
            <line>A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;</line>
            <line>She never had so sweet a changeling;</line>
            <line>And jealous Oberon would have the child</line>
            <line>Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;</line>
            <line>But she perforce withholds the loved boy,</line>
            <line>Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:</line>
            <line>And now they never meet in grove or green,</line>
            <line>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</line>
            <line>But, they do square, that all their elves for fear</line>
            <line>Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Fairy</speaker>
            <line>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</line>
            <line>Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite</line>
            <line>Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he</line>
            <line>That frights the maidens of the villagery;</line>
            <line>Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern</line>
            <line>And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;</line>
            <line>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;</line>
            <line>Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?</line>
            <line>Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,</line>
            <line>You do their work, and they shall have good luck:</line>
            <line>Are not you he?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PUCK</speaker>
            <line>Thou speak'st aright;</line>
            <line>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</line>
            <line>I jest to Oberon and make him smile</line>
            <line>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</line>
            <line>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:</line>
            <line>And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,</line>
            <line>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</line>
            <line>And when she drinks, against her lips I bob</line>
            <line>And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.</line>
            <line>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</line>
            <line>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</line>
            <line>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</line>
            <line>And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;</line>
            <line>And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,</line>
            <line>And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear</line>
            <line>A merrier hour was never wasted there.</line>
            <line>But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Fairy</speaker>
            <line>And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train;
from the other, TITANIA, with hers</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
            <line>What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:</line>
            <line>I have forsworn his bed and company.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
            <line>Then I must be thy lady: but I know</line>
            <line>When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,</line>
            <line>And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</line>
            <line>Playing on pipes of corn and versing love</line>
            <line>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,</line>
            <line>Come from the farthest Steppe of India?</line>
            <line>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</line>
            <line>Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,</line>
            <line>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</line>
            <line>To give their bed joy and prosperity.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</line>
            <line>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</line>
            <line>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</line>
            <line>Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night</line>
            <line>From Perigenia, whom he ravished?</line>
            <line>And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,</line>
            <line>With Ariadne and Antiopa?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
            <line>These are the forgeries of jealousy:</line>
            <line>And never, since the middle summer's spring,</line>
            <line>Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,</line>
            <line>By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</line>
            <line>Or in the beached margent of the sea,</line>
            <line>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</line>
            <line>But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.</line>
            <line>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</line>
            <line>As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea</line>
            <line>Contagious fogs; which falling in the land</line>
            <line>Have every pelting river made so proud</line>
            <line>That they have overborne their continents:</line>
            <line>The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,</line>
            <line>The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</line>
            <line>Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;</line>
            <line>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</line>
            <line>And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;</line>
            <line>The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,</line>
            <line>And the quaint mazes in the wanton green</line>
            <line>For lack of tread are undistinguishable:</line>
            <line>The human mortals want their winter here;</line>
            <line>No night is now with hymn or carol blest:</line>
            <line>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,</line>
            <line>Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</line>
            <line>That rheumatic diseases do abound:</line>
            <line>And thorough this distemperature we see</line>
            <line>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</line>
            <line>Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</line>
            <line>And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown</line>
            <line>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</line>
            <line>Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,</line>
            <line>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</line>
            <line>Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,</line>
            <line>By their increase, now knows not which is which:</line>
            <line>And this same progeny of evils comes</line>
            <line>From our debate, from our dissension;</line>
            <line>We are their parents and original.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>Do you amend it then; it lies in you:</line>
            <line>Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</line>
            <line>I do but beg a little changeling boy,</line>
            <line>To be my henchman.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
            <line>Set your heart at rest:</line>
            <line>The fairy land buys not the child of me.</line>
            <line>His mother was a votaress of my order:</line>
            <line>And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,</line>
            <line>Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,</line>
            <line>And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,</line>
            <line>Marking the embarked traders on the flood,</line>
            <line>When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive</line>
            <line>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</line>
            <line>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait</line>
            <line>Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--</line>
            <line>Would imitate, and sail upon the land,</line>
            <line>To fetch me trifles, and return again,</line>
            <line>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</line>
            <line>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;</line>
            <line>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,</line>
            <line>And for her sake I will not part with him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>How long within this wood intend you stay?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
            <line>Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.</line>
            <line>If you will patiently dance in our round</line>
            <line>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</line>
            <line>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TITANIA</speaker>
            <line>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!</line>
            <line>We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit TITANIA with her train</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove</line>
            <line>Till I torment thee for this injury.</line>
            <line>My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest</line>
            <line>Since once I sat upon a promontory,</line>
            <line>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back</line>
            <line>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</line>
            <line>That the rude sea grew civil at her song</line>
            <line>And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,</line>
            <line>To hear the sea-maid's music.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PUCK</speaker>
            <line>I remember.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,</line>
            <line>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</line>
            <line>Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took</line>
            <line>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</line>
            <line>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</line>
            <line>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</line>
            <line>But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft</line>
            <line>Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,</line>
            <line>And the imperial votaress passed on,</line>
            <line>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</line>
            <line>Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:</line>
            <line>It fell upon a little western flower,</line>
            <line>Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,</line>
            <line>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</line>
            <line>Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:</line>
            <line>The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid</line>
            <line>Will make or man or woman madly dote</line>
            <line>Upon the next live creature that it sees.</line>
            <line>Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again</line>
            <line>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PUCK</speaker>
            <line>I'll put a girdle round about the earth</line>
            <line>In forty minutes.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OBERON</speaker>
            <line>Having once this juice,</line>
            <line>I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,</line>
            <line>And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.</line>
            <line>The next thing then she waking looks upon,</line>
            <line>Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,</line>
            <line>On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,</line>
            <line>She shall pursue it with the soul of love:</line>
            <line>And ere I take this charm from off her sight,</line>
            <line>As I can take it with another herb,</line>
            <line>I'll make her render up her page to me.</line>
            <line>But who comes here? I am invisible;</line>
            <line>And I will overhear their conference.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
            <line>I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.</line>
            <line>Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?</line>
            <line>The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.</line>
            <line>Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;</line>
            <line>And here am I, and wode within this wood,</line>
            <line>Because I cannot meet my Hermia.</line>
            <line>Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;</line>
            <line>But yet you draw not iron, for my heart</line>
            <line>Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,</line>
            <line>And I shall have no power to follow you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
            <line>Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?</line>
            <line>Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth</line>
            <line>Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>And even for that do I love you the more.</line>
            <line>I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,</line>
            <line>The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:</line>
            <line>Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,</line>
            <line>Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,</line>
            <line>Unworthy as I am, to follow you.</line>
            <line>What worser place can I beg in your love,--</line>
            <line>And yet a place of high respect with me,--</line>
            <line>Than to be used as you use your dog?</line>

            <line>Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;</line>
            <line>For I am sick when I do look on thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>And I am sick when I look not on you.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
            <line>You do impeach your modesty too much,</line>
            <line>To leave the city and commit yourself</line>
            <line>Into the hands of one that loves you not;</line>
            <line>To trust the opportunity of night</line>
            <line>And the ill counsel of a desert place</line>
            <line>With the rich worth of your virginity.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Your virtue is my privilege: for that</line>
            <line>It is not night when I do see your face,</line>
            <line>Therefore I think I am not in the night;</line>
            <line>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</line>

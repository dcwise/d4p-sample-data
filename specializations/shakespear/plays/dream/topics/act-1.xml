            <line>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</line>
            <line>Draws on apace; four happy days bring in</line>
            <line>Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow</line>
            <line>This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,</line>
            <line>Like to a step-dame or a dowager</line>
            <line>Long withering out a young man revenue.</line>

            <line>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</line>
            <line>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</line>
            <line>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</line>
            <line>New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night</line>
            <line>Of our solemnities.</line>

            <line>Go, Philostrate,</line>
            <line>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;</line>
            <line>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;</line>
            <line>Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</line>
            <line>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit PHILOSTRATE</stagedir>
            <line>Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,</line>
            <line>And won thy love, doing thee injuries;</line>
            <line>But I will wed thee in another key,</line>
            <line>With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
            <line>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</line>
            <line>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</line>
            <line>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</line>
            <line>This man hath my consent to marry her.</line>
            <line>Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,</line>
            <line>This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;</line>
            <line>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</line>
            <line>And interchanged love-tokens with my child:</line>
            <line>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</line>
            <line>With feigning voice verses of feigning love,</line>
            <line>And stolen the impression of her fantasy</line>
            <line>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</line>
            <line>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers</line>
            <line>Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:</line>
            <line>With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,</line>
            <line>Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,</line>
            <line>To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,</line>
            <line>Be it so she; will not here before your grace</line>
            <line>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</line>
            <line>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,</line>
            <line>As she is mine, I may dispose of her:</line>
            <line>Which shall be either to this gentleman</line>
            <line>Or to her death, according to our law</line>
            <line>Immediately provided in that case.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
            <line>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:</line>
            <line>To you your father should be as a god;</line>
            <line>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one</line>
            <line>To whom you are but as a form in wax</line>
            <line>By him imprinted and within his power</line>
            <line>To leave the figure or disfigure it.</line>
            <line>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>So is Lysander.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
            <line>In himself he is;</line>
            <line>But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,</line>
            <line>The other must be held the worthier.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>I would my father look'd but with my eyes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
            <line>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>I do entreat your grace to pardon me.</line>
            <line>I know not by what power I am made bold,</line>
            <line>Nor how it may concern my modesty,</line>
            <line>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</line>
            <line>But I beseech your grace that I may know</line>
            <line>The worst that may befall me in this case,</line>
            <line>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
            <line>Either to die the death or to abjure</line>
            <line>For ever the society of men.</line>
            <line>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;</line>
            <line>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</line>
            <line>Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,</line>
            <line>You can endure the livery of a nun,</line>
            <line>For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,</line>
            <line>To live a barren sister all your life,</line>
            <line>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</line>
            <line>Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,</line>
            <line>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</line>
            <line>But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,</line>
            <line>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</line>
            <line>Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</line>
            <line>Ere I will my virgin patent up</line>
            <line>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</line>
            <line>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
            <line>Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--</line>
            <line>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,</line>
            <line>For everlasting bond of fellowship--</line>
            <line>Upon that day either prepare to die</line>
            <line>For disobedience to your father's will,</line>
            <line>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;</line>
            <line>Or on Diana's altar to protest</line>
            <line>For aye austerity and single life.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
            <line>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield</line>
            <line>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>You have her father's love, Demetrius;</line>
            <line>Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
            <line>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,</line>
            <line>And what is mine my love shall render him.</line>
            <line>And she is mine, and all my right of her</line>
            <line>I do estate unto Demetrius.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,</line>
            <line>As well possess'd; my love is more than his;</line>
            <line>My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,</line>
            <line>If not with vantage, as Demetrius';</line>
            <line>And, which is more than all these boasts can be,</line>
            <line>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:</line>
            <line>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</line>
            <line>Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,</line>
            <line>Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,</line>
            <line>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</line>
            <line>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</line>
            <line>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>THESEUS</speaker>
            <line>I must confess that I have heard so much,</line>
            <line>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</line>
            <line>But, being over-full of self-affairs,</line>
            <line>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;</line>
            <line>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,</line>
            <line>I have some private schooling for you both.</line>
            <line>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</line>
            <line>To fit your fancies to your father's will;</line>
            <line>Or else the law of Athens yields you up--</line>
            <line>Which by no means we may extenuate--</line>
            <line>To death, or to a vow of single life.</line>
            <line>Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?</line>
            <line>Demetrius and Egeus, go along:</line>
            <line>I must employ you in some business</line>
            <line>Against our nuptial and confer with you</line>
            <line>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EGEUS</speaker>
            <line>With duty and desire we follow you.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?</line>
            <line>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>Belike for want of rain, which I could well</line>
            <line>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,</line>
            <line>Could ever hear by tale or history,</line>
            <line>The course of true love never did run smooth;</line>
            <line>But, either it was different in blood,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>O spite! too old to be engaged to young.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</line>
            <line>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</line>
            <line>Making it momentany as a sound,</line>
            <line>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;</line>
            <line>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</line>
            <line>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,</line>
            <line>And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'</line>
            <line>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</line>
            <line>So quick bright things come to confusion.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,</line>
            <line>It stands as an edict in destiny:</line>
            <line>Then let us teach our trial patience,</line>
            <line>Because it is a customary cross,</line>
            <line>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</line>
            <line>Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.</line>
            <line>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</line>
            <line>Of great revenue, and she hath no child:</line>
            <line>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;</line>
            <line>And she respects me as her only son.</line>
            <line>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</line>
            <line>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</line>
            <line>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,</line>
            <line>Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;</line>
            <line>And in the wood, a league without the town,</line>
            <line>Where I did meet thee once with Helena,</line>
            <line>To do observance to a morn of May,</line>
            <line>There will I stay for thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>My good Lysander!</line>
            <line>I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,</line>
            <line>By his best arrow with the golden head,</line>
            <line>By the simplicity of Venus' doves,</line>
            <line>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</line>
            <line>And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,</line>
            <line>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</line>
            <line>By all the vows that ever men have broke,</line>
            <line>In number more than ever women spoke,</line>
            <line>In that same place thou hast appointed me,</line>
            <line>To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LYSANDER</speaker>
            <line>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter HELENA</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>God speed fair Helena! whither away?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.</line>
            <line>Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!</line>
            <line>Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air</line>
            <line>More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,</line>
            <line>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</line>
            <line>Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,</line>
            <line>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</line>
            <line>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</line>
            <line>My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.</line>
            <line>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</line>
            <line>The rest I'd give to be to you translated.</line>
            <line>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</line>
            <line>You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
            <line>O that my prayers could such affection move!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HERMIA</speaker>
            <line>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</line>

            <line>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</line>

            <line>Before the time I did Lysander see,</line>

            <line>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</line>

            <line>Her silver visage in the watery glass,</line>
            <line>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,</line>
            <line>A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,</line>
            <line>Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.</line>

            <line>And in the wood, where often you and I</line>
            <line>Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,</line>
            <line>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</line>
            <line>There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</line>
            <line>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</line>
            <line>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</line>
            <line>Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;</line>
            <line>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</line>
            <line>Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight</line>

            <line>How happy some o'er other some can be!</line>
            <line>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</line>
            <line>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</line>
            <line>He will not know what all but he do know:</line>
            <line>And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,</line>
            <line>So I, admiring of his qualities:</line>
            <line>Things base and vile, folding no quantity,</line>
            <line>Love can transpose to form and dignity:</line>
            <line>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</line>
            <line>And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:</line>
            <line>Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;</line>
            <line>Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:</line>
            <line>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</line>
            <line>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</line>
            <line>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</line>
            <line>So the boy Love is perjured every where:</line>
            <line>For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,</line>
            <line>He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;</line>
            <line>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</line>
            <line>So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.</line>
            <line>I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:</line>
            <line>Then to the wood will he to-morrow night</line>
            <line>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</line>
            <line>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:</line>
            <line>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</line>
            <line>To have his sight thither and back again.</line>

            <line>Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will</line>

            <line>Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place</line>
            <line>for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our</line>

            <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
            <line>There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and</line>
            <line>Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must</line>
            <line>draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies</line>
            <line>cannot abide. How answer you that?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
            <line>By'r lakin, a parlous fear.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
            <line>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
            <line>Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.</line>
            <line>Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to</line>
            <line>say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that</line>
            <line>Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more</line>
            <line>better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not</line>
            <line>Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them</line>
            <line>out of fear.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
            <line>Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be</line>
            <line>written in eight and six.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
            <line>No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
            <line>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>STARVELING</speaker>
            <line>I fear it, I promise you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
            <line>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to</line>
            <line>bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a</line>
            <line>most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful</line>
            <line>wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to</line>
            <line>look to 't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
            <line>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
            <line>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must</line>
            <line>be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself</line>
            <line>must speak through, saying thus, or to the same</line>
            <line>defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish</line>
            <line>You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would</line>
            <line>entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life</line>
            <line>for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it</line>
            <line>were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a</line>
            <line>man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name</line>
            <line>his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
            <line>Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;</line>
            <line>that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,</line>
            <line>you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
            <line>Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
            <line>A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find</line>
            <line>out moonshine, find out moonshine.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
            <line>Yes, it doth shine that night.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
            <line>Why, then may you leave a casement of the great</line>
            <line>chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon</line>
            <line>may shine in at the casement.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
            <line>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns</line>
            <line>and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to</line>
            <line>present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is</line>
            <line>another thing: we must have a wall in the great</line>
            <line>chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did</line>
            <line>talk through the chink of a wall.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SNOUT</speaker>
            <line>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BOTTOM</speaker>
            <line>Some man or other must present Wall: and let him</line>
            <line>have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast</line>
            <line>about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his</line>
            <line>fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus</line>
            <line>and Thisby whisper.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUINCE</speaker>
            <line>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,</line>
            <line>every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.</line>
            <line>Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your</line>
            <line>speech, enter into that brake: and so every one</line>
            <line>according to his cue.</line>

            <line>What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;</line>
            <line>An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,</line>

            <line>Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!</line>
            <line>Have you conspired, have you with these contrived</line>
            <line>To bait me with this foul derision?</line>
            <line>Is all the counsel that we two have shared,</line>

            <line>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</line>
            <line>For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?</line>

            <line>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</line>

            <line>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</line>
            <line>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,</line>
            <line>As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,</line>

            <line>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</line>
            <line>Due but to one and crowned with one crest.</line>
            <line>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,</line>
            <line>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</line>
            <line>It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:</line>

            <line>Deny your love, so rich within his soul,</line>
            <line>And tender me, forsooth, affection,</line>
            <line>But by your setting on, by your consent?</line>
            <line>What thought I be not so in grace as you,</line>
            <line>So hung upon with love, so fortunate,</line>

            <line>With drooping fog as black as Acheron,</line>

            <line>Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,</line>

            <line>When they next wake, all this derision</line>

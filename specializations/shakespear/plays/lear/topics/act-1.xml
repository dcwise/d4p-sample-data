            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>I thought the king had more affected the Duke of</line>
            <line>Albany than Cornwall.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>It did always seem so to us: but now, in the</line>
            <line>division of the kingdom, it appears not which of</line>
            <line>the dukes he values most; for equalities are so</line>
            <line>weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice</line>
            <line>of either's moiety.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>Is not this your son, my lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have</line>
            <line>so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am</line>
            <line>brazed to it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>I cannot conceive you.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon</line>
            <line>she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son</line>
            <line>for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.</line>
            <line>Do you smell a fault?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it</line>
            <line>being so proper.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year</line>
            <line>elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:</line>
            <line>though this knave came something saucily into the</line>
            <line>world before he was sent for, yet was his mother</line>
            <line>fair; there was good sport at his making, and the</line>
            <line>whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this</line>
            <line>noble gentleman, Edmund?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EDMUND</speaker>
            <line>No, my lord.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my</line>

            <line>He hath been out nine years, and away he shall</line>

         <stagedir>Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY,

            <speaker>KING LEAR</speaker>

         <speech>

            <line>I shall, my liege.</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING LEAR</speaker>
            <line>Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.</line>
            <line>Give me the map there. Know that we have divided</line>
            <line>In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent</line>
            <line>To shake all cares and business from our age;</line>
            <line>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</line>
            <line>Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,</line>
            <line>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</line>
            <line>We have this hour a constant will to publish</line>
            <line>Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife</line>
            <line>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</line>
            <line>Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,</line>
            <line>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</line>
            <line>And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--</line>
            <line>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</line>
            <line>Interest of territory, cares of state,--</line>
            <line>Which of you shall we say doth love us most?</line>
            <line>That we our largest bounty may extend</line>
            <line>Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,</line>
            <line>Our eldest-born, speak first.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GONERIL</speaker>
            <line>Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;</line>
            <line>Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;</line>
            <line>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;</line>
            <line>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;</line>
            <line>As much as child e'er loved, or father found;</line>
            <line>A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;</line>
            <line>Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORDELIA</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  What shall Cordelia do?</line>
            <line>Love, and be silent.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEAR</speaker>
            <line>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</line>
            <line>With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,</line>
            <line>With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,</line>
            <line>We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue</line>
            <line>Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,</line>
            <line>Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>REGAN</speaker>
            <line>Sir, I am made</line>
            <line>Of the self-same metal that my sister is,</line>
            <line>And prize me at her worth. In my true heart</line>
            <line>I find she names my very deed of love;</line>
            <line>Only she comes too short: that I profess</line>
            <line>Myself an enemy to all other joys,</line>
            <line>Which the most precious square of sense possesses;</line>
            <line>And find I am alone felicitate</line>
            <line>In your dear highness' love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORDELIA</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir> Then poor Cordelia!</line>
            <line>And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's</line>
            <line>More richer than my tongue.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING LEAR</speaker>
            <line>To thee and thine hereditary ever</line>
            <line>Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;</line>
            <line>No less in space, validity, and pleasure,</line>
            <line>Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,</line>
            <line>Although the last, not least; to whose young love</line>
            <line>The vines of France and milk of Burgundy</line>
            <line>Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw</line>
            <line>A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORDELIA</speaker>
            <line>Nothing, my lord.</line>

            <speaker>CORDELIA</speaker>
            <line>Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave</line>
            <line>My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty</line>
            <line>According to my bond; nor more nor less.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING LEAR</speaker>
            <line>How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,</line>
            <line>Lest it may mar your fortunes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORDELIA</speaker>
            <line>Good my lord,</line>
            <line>You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I</line>
            <line>Return those duties back as are right fit,</line>
            <line>Obey you, love you, and most honour you.</line>
            <line>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say</line>
            <line>They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,</line>
            <line>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</line>
            <line>Half my love with him, half my care and duty:</line>
            <line>Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,</line>
            <line>To love my father all.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING LEAR</speaker>
            <line>But goes thy heart with this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORDELIA</speaker>
            <line>Ay, good my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING LEAR</speaker>
            <line>So young, and so untender?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CORDELIA</speaker>
            <line>So young, my lord, and true.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING LEAR</speaker>
            <line>Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:</line>
            <line>For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,</line>
            <line>The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;</line>
            <line>By all the operation of the orbs</line>
            <line>From whom we do exist, and cease to be;</line>
            <line>Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</line>
            <line>Propinquity and property of blood,</line>
            <line>And as a stranger to my heart and me</line>
            <line>Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,</line>
            <line>Or he that makes his generation messes</line>
            <line>To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</line>
            <line>Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,</line>
            <line>As thou my sometime daughter.</line>

            <speaker>KING LEAR</speaker>
            <line>Peace, Kent!</line>
            <line>Come not between the dragon and his wrath.</line>
            <line>I loved her most, and thought to set my rest</line>
            <line>On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!</line>
            <line>So be my grave my peace, as here I give</line>
            <line>Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?</line>
            <line>Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,</line>
            <line>With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:</line>
            <line>Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.</line>
            <line>I do invest you jointly with my power,</line>
            <line>Pre-eminence, and all the large effects</line>
            <line>That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,</line>
            <line>With reservation of an hundred knights,</line>
            <line>By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode</line>
            <line>Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain</line>
            <line>The name, and all the additions to a king;</line>
            <line>The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,</line>
            <line>Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,</line>

            <line>Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,</line>
            <line>When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,</line>

            <line>Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;</line>

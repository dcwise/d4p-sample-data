         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>One minded like the weather, most unquietly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>I know you. Where's the king?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Contending with the fretful element:</line>
            <line>Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,</line>
            <line>Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,</line>
            <line>That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,</line>
            <line>Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,</line>
            <line>Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;</line>
            <line>Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn</line>
            <line>The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.</line>
            <line>This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,</line>
            <line>The lion and the belly-pinched wolf</line>
            <line>Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,</line>
            <line>And bids what will take all.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>But who is with him?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>None but the fool; who labours to out-jest</line>
            <line>His heart-struck injuries.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>Sir, I do know you;</line>
            <line>And dare, upon the warrant of my note,</line>
            <line>Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,</line>
            <line>Although as yet the face of it be cover'd</line>
            <line>With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;</line>
            <line>Who have--as who have not, that their great stars</line>
            <line>Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,</line>
            <line>Which are to France the spies and speculations</line>
            <line>Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,</line>
            <line>Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,</line>
            <line>Or the hard rein which both of them have borne</line>
            <line>Against the old kind king; or something deeper,</line>
            <line>Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;</line>
            <line>But, true it is, from France there comes a power</line>
            <line>Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,</line>
            <line>Wise in our negligence, have secret feet</line>
            <line>In some of our best ports, and are at point</line>
            <line>To show their open banner. Now to you:</line>
            <line>If on my credit you dare build so far</line>
            <line>To make your speed to Dover, you shall find</line>
            <line>Some that will thank you, making just report</line>
            <line>Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow</line>
            <line>The king hath cause to plain.</line>
            <line>I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;</line>
            <line>And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer</line>
            <line>This office to you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I will talk further with you.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>No, do not.</line>
            <line>For confirmation that I am much more</line>
            <line>Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take</line>
            <line>What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--</line>
            <line>As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;</line>
            <line>And she will tell you who your fellow is</line>
            <line>That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!</line>
            <line>I will go seek the king.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Give me your hand: have you no more to say?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KENT</speaker>
            <line>Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;</line>
            <line>That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain</line>
            <line>That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him</line>

            <line>When every case in law is right;</line>
            <line>No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;</line>
            <line>When slanders do not live in tongues;</line>
            <line>Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;</line>
            <line>When usurers tell their gold i' the field;</line>
            <line>And bawds and whores do churches build;</line>
            <line>Then shall the realm of Albion</line>
            <line>Come to great confusion:</line>
            <line>Then comes the time, who lives to see't,</line>

            <line>Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;</line>
            <line>But that I told him, the revenging gods</line>
            <line>'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;</line>
            <line>Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond</line>
            <line>The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,</line>
            <line>Seeing how loathly opposite I stood</line>
            <line>To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,</line>
            <line>With his prepared sword, he charges home</line>
            <line>My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:</line>
            <line>But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,</line>
            <line>Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,</line>
            <line>Or whether gasted by the noise I made,</line>
            <line>Full suddenly he fled.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Let him fly far:</line>
            <line>Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;</line>
            <line>And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,</line>
            <line>My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:</line>
            <line>By his authority I will proclaim it,</line>
            <line>That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,</line>
            <line>Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;</line>
            <line>He that conceals him, death.</line>

            <line>When I dissuaded him from his intent,</line>
            <line>And found him pight to do it, with curst speech</line>
            <line>I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,</line>

            <line>If I would stand against thee, would the reposal</line>
            <line>Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee</line>
            <line>Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--</line>
            <line>As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce</line>
            <line>My very character,--I'ld turn it all</line>
            <line>To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:</line>
            <line>And thou must make a dullard of the world,</line>
            <line>If they not thought the profits of my death</line>

            <line>Strong and fasten'd villain</line>

            <line>Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.</line>
            <line>All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;</line>
            <line>The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture</line>
            <line>I will send far and near, that all the kingdom</line>
            <line>May have the due note of him; and of my land,</line>
            <line>Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means</line>
            <line>To make thee capable.</line>

            <line>No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:</line>
            <line>'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,</line>

            <line>I have this present evening from my sister</line>

            <line>To answer from our home; the several messengers</line>

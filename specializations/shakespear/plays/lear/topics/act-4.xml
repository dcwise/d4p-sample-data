            <line>The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,</line>
            <line>Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:</line>
            <line>The lamentable change is from the best;</line>
            <line>The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,</line>

            <line>fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as</line>

            <line>The crows and choughs that wing the midway air</line>

            <line>Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy</line>
            <line>Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,</line>
            <line>That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,</line>

            <line>The appetite may sicken, and so die.</line>
            <line>That strain again! it had a dying fall:</line>
            <line>O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,</line>
            <line>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</line>
            <line>Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:</line>

            <line>But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk</line>

            <line>And speak to him in many sorts of music</line>

            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.</line>

         <speech>

            <line>Good madam, let me see your face.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate</line>

            <line>Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't</line>

            <line>Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,</line>

            <line>O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give</line>
            <line>out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be</line>
            <line>inventoried, and every particle and utensil</line>
            <line>labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,</line>
            <line>indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to</line>
            <line>them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were</line>

            <line>I see you what you are, you are too proud;</line>
            <line>But, if you were the devil, you are fair.</line>
            <line>My lord and master loves you: O, such love</line>
            <line>Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd</line>
            <line>The nonpareil of beauty!</line>

            <line>Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;</line>
            <line>In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;</line>
            <line>And in dimension and the shape of nature</line>
            <line>A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;</line>

            <line>Write loyal cantons of contemned love</line>
            <line>And sing them loud even in the dead of night;</line>
            <line>Halloo your name to the reverberate hills</line>
            <line>And make the babbling gossip of the air</line>
            <line>Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest</line>

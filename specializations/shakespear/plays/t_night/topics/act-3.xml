         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by</line>
            <line>thy tabour?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>No, sir, I live by the church.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Art thou a churchman?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for</line>
            <line>I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by</line>
            <line>the church.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a</line>
            <line>beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy</line>
            <line>tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is</line>
            <line>but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the</line>
            <line>wrong side may be turned outward!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with</line>
            <line>words may quickly make them wanton.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Why, man?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that</line>
            <line>word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words</line>
            <line>are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Thy reason, man?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and</line>
            <line>words are grown so false, I am loath to prove</line>
            <line>reason with them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my</line>
            <line>conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be</line>
            <line>to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she</line>
            <line>will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and</line>
            <line>fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to</line>
            <line>herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not</line>
            <line>her fool, but her corrupter of words.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,</line>
            <line>it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but</line>
            <line>the fool should be as oft with your master as with</line>
            <line>my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.</line>
            <line>Hold, there's expenses for thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for</line>
            <line>one;</line>
            <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>
            <line>though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy</line>
            <line>lady within?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Yes, being kept together and put to use.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring</line>
            <line>a Cressida to this Troilus.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Clown</speaker>
            <line>The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but</line>
            <line>a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is</line>
            <line>within, sir. I will construe to them whence you</line>
            <line>come; who you are and what you would are out of my</line>
            <line>welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;</line>
            <line>And to do that well craves a kind of wit:</line>
            <line>He must observe their mood on whom he jests,</line>
            <line>The quality of persons, and the time,</line>
            <line>And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather</line>
            <line>That comes before his eye. This is a practise</line>
            <line>As full of labour as a wise man's art</line>
            <line>For folly that he wisely shows is fit;</line>
            <line>But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.</line>

            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>My legs do better understand me, sir, than I</line>

            <line>What is your name?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world</line>
            <line>Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:</line>
            <line>You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:</line>
            <line>Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,</line>
            <line>Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>O, by your leave, I pray you,</line>
            <line>I bade you never speak again of him:</line>
            <line>But, would you undertake another suit,</line>
            <line>I had rather hear you to solicit that</line>
            <line>Than music from the spheres.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Dear lady,--</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,</line>
            <line>After the last enchantment you did here,</line>
            <line>A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse</line>
            <line>Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:</line>
            <line>Under your hard construction must I sit,</line>
            <line>To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,</line>
            <line>Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?</line>
            <line>Have you not set mine honour at the stake</line>
            <line>And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts</line>
            <line>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving</line>
            <line>Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,</line>
            <line>Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>I pity you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>That's a degree to love.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,</line>
            <line>That very oft we pity enemies.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.</line>
            <line>O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!</line>
            <line>If one should be a prey, how much the better</line>
            <line>To fall before the lion than the wolf!</line>
            <stagedir>Clock strikes</stagedir>
            <line>The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.</line>
            <line>Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:</line>
            <line>And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,</line>
            <line>Your were is alike to reap a proper man:</line>
            <line>There lies your way, due west.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition</line>
            <line>Attend your ladyship!</line>
            <line>You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?</line>

            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>Stay:</line>
            <line>I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>That you do think you are not what you are.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>If I think so, I think the same of you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Then think you right: I am not what I am.</line>

         <speech>

            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>Would it be better, madam, than I am?</line>
            <line>I wish it might, for now I am your fool.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful</line>
            <line>In the contempt and anger of his lip!</line>
            <line>A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon</line>
            <line>Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.</line>
            <line>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</line>
            <line>By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,</line>
            <line>I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,</line>
            <line>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.</line>
            <line>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</line>
            <line>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,</line>
            <line>But rather reason thus with reason fetter,</line>
            <line>Love sought is good, but given unsought better.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>By innocence I swear, and by my youth</line>
            <line>I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,</line>
            <line>And that no woman has; nor never none</line>
            <line>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.</line>
            <line>And so adieu, good madam: never more</line>
            <line>Will I my master's tears to you deplore.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
            <line>Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move</line>
            <line>That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.</line>

            <line>No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.</line>

            <line>Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.</line>

            <line>You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR ANDREW</speaker>
            <line>Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the</line>
            <line>count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;</line>
            <line>I saw't i' the orchard.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR ANDREW</speaker>
            <line>As plain as I see you now.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FABIAN</speaker>
            <line>This was a great argument of love in her toward you.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR ANDREW</speaker>
            <line>'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FABIAN</speaker>
            <line>I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of</line>
            <line>judgment and reason.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>FABIAN</speaker>
            <line>She did show favour to the youth in your sight only</line>
            <line>to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to</line>
            <line>put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.</line>
            <line>You should then have accosted her; and with some</line>
            <line>excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should</line>
            <line>have banged the youth into dumbness. This was</line>
            <line>looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the</line>
            <line>double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash</line>
            <line>off, and you are now sailed into the north of my</line>
            <line>lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle</line>
            <line>on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by</line>
            <line>some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR ANDREW</speaker>
            <line>An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy</line>
            <line>I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of</line>
            <line>valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight</line>
            <line>with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall</line>
            <line>take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no</line>
            <line>love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's</line>
            <line>commendation with woman than report of valour.</line>

            <line>Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;</line>
            <line>it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun</line>
            <line>of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:</line>
            <line>if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be</line>
            <line>amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of</line>
            <line>paper, although the sheet were big enough for the</line>
            <line>bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.</line>
            <line>Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou</line>
            <line>write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.</line>

            <line>We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.</line>

         <stagedir>Exit SIR ANDREW</stagedir>

            <line>I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand</line>

            <speaker>FABIAN</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the</line>
            <line>youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes</line>
            <line>cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were</line>
            <line>opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as</line>
            <line>will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FABIAN</speaker>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARIA</speaker>
            <line>If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself</line>
            <line>into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is</line>
            <line>turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no</line>
            <line>Christian, that means to be saved by believing</line>
            <line>rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages</line>

            <speaker>MARIA</speaker>
            <line>Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school</line>
            <line>i' the church. I have dogged him, like his</line>
            <line>murderer. He does obey every point of the letter</line>
            <line>that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his</line>
            <line>face into more lines than is in the new map with the</line>
            <line>augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such</line>
            <line>a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things</line>
            <line>at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,</line>
            <line>he'll smile and take't for a great favour.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what</line>
            <line>nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know</line>
            <line>not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as</line>
            <line>the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:</line>
            <line>dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for</line>
            <line>thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.</line>

            <line>You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,</line>
            <line>if you hold your life at any price, betake you to</line>
            <line>your guard; for your opposite hath in him what</line>
            <line>youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.</line>

         <speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on</line>
            <line>carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private</line>
            <line>brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and</line>
            <line>his incensement at this moment is so implacable,</line>
            <line>that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death</line>
            <line>and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>I will return again into the house and desire some</line>
            <line>conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard</line>
            <line>of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on</line>
            <line>others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man</line>
            <line>of that quirk.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a</line>
            <line>very competent injury: therefore, get you on and</line>
            <line>give him his desire. Back you shall not to the</line>
            <line>house, unless you undertake that with me which with</line>
            <line>as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,</line>
            <line>or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you</line>
            <line>must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VIOLA</speaker>
            <line>This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me</line>
            <line>this courteous office, as to know of the knight what</line>
            <line>my offence to him is: it is something of my</line>
            <line>negligence, nothing of my purpose.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SIR TOBY BELCH</speaker>
            <line>I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this</line>

            <line>his form, as you are like to find him in the proof</line>
            <line>of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,</line>
            <line>bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly</line>
            <line>have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk</line>

            <line>firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and</line>
            <line>all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal</line>
            <line>motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he</line>
            <line>pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they</line>

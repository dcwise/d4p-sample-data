            <line>This is the air; that is the glorious sun;</line>
            <line>This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;</line>
            <line>And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,</line>
            <line>Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?</line>
            <line>I could not find him at the Elephant:</line>
            <line>Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,</line>
            <line>That he did range the town to seek me out.</line>
            <line>His counsel now might do me golden service;</line>
            <line>For though my soul disputes well with my sense,</line>
            <line>That this may be some error, but no madness,</line>
            <line>Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune</line>
            <line>So far exceed all instance, all discourse,</line>
            <line>That I am ready to distrust mine eyes</line>
            <line>And wrangle with my reason that persuades me</line>
            <line>To any other trust but that I am mad</line>
            <line>Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,</line>
            <line>She could not sway her house, command her followers,</line>
            <line>Take and give back affairs and their dispatch</line>
            <line>With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing</line>
            <line>As I perceive she does: there's something in't</line>

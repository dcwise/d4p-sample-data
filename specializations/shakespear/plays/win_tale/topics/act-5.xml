      <title>SCENE I.  A room in LEONTES' palace.</title>
      <scene-body>
         <stagedir>Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLEOMENES</speaker>
            <line>Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd</line>
            <line>A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,</line>
            <line>Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down</line>
            <line>More penitence than done trespass: at the last,</line>
            <line>Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;</line>
            <line>With them forgive yourself.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Whilst I remember</line>
            <line>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget</line>
            <line>My blemishes in them, and so still think of</line>
            <line>The wrong I did myself; which was so much,</line>
            <line>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and</line>
            <line>Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man</line>
            <line>Bred his hopes out of.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>True, too true, my lord:</line>
            <line>If, one by one, you wedded all the world,</line>
            <line>Or from the all that are took something good,</line>
            <line>To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd</line>
            <line>Would be unparallel'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>I think so. Kill'd!</line>
            <line>She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me</line>
            <line>Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter</line>
            <line>Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,</line>
            <line>Say so but seldom.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLEOMENES</speaker>
            <line>Not at all, good lady:</line>
            <line>You might have spoken a thousand things that would</line>
            <line>Have done the time more benefit and graced</line>
            <line>Your kindness better.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>You are one of those</line>
            <line>Would have him wed again.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DION</speaker>
            <line>If you would not so,</line>
            <line>You pity not the state, nor the remembrance</line>
            <line>Of his most sovereign name; consider little</line>
            <line>What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,</line>
            <line>May drop upon his kingdom and devour</line>
            <line>Incertain lookers on. What were more holy</line>
            <line>Than to rejoice the former queen is well?</line>
            <line>What holier than, for royalty's repair,</line>
            <line>For present comfort and for future good,</line>
            <line>To bless the bed of majesty again</line>
            <line>With a sweet fellow to't?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>There is none worthy,</line>
            <line>Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods</line>
            <line>Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;</line>
            <line>For has not the divine Apollo said,</line>
            <line>Is't not the tenor of his oracle,</line>
            <line>That King Leontes shall not have an heir</line>
            <line>Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,</line>
            <line>Is all as monstrous to our human reason</line>
            <line>As my Antigonus to break his grave</line>
            <line>And come again to me; who, on my life,</line>
            <line>Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel</line>
            <line>My lord should to the heavens be contrary,</line>
            <line>Oppose against their wills.</line>
            <stagedir>To LEONTES</stagedir>
            <line>Care not for issue;</line>
            <line>The crown will find an heir: great Alexander</line>
            <line>Left his to the worthiest; so his successor</line>
            <line>Was like to be the best.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Good Paulina,</line>
            <line>Who hast the memory of Hermione,</line>
            <line>I know, in honour, O, that ever I</line>
            <line>Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,</line>
            <line>I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,</line>
            <line>Have taken treasure from her lips--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>And left them</line>
            <line>More rich for what they yielded.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Thou speak'st truth.</line>
            <line>No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,</line>
            <line>And better used, would make her sainted spirit</line>
            <line>Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,</line>
            <line>Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,</line>
            <line>And begin, 'Why to me?'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>Had she such power,</line>
            <line>She had just cause.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>She had; and would incense me</line>
            <line>To murder her I married.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>I should so.</line>
            <line>Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark</line>
            <line>Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't</line>
            <line>You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears</line>
            <line>Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd</line>
            <line>Should be 'Remember mine.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Stars, stars,</line>
            <line>And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;</line>
            <line>I'll have no wife, Paulina.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>Will you swear</line>
            <line>Never to marry but by my free leave?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLEOMENES</speaker>
            <line>You tempt him over-much.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>Unless another,</line>
            <line>As like Hermione as is her picture,</line>
            <line>Affront his eye.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLEOMENES</speaker>
            <line>Good madam,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>I have done.</line>
            <line>Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,</line>
            <line>No remedy, but you will,--give me the office</line>
            <line>To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young</line>
            <line>As was your former; but she shall be such</line>
            <line>As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,</line>
            <line>it should take joy</line>
            <line>To see her in your arms.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>My true Paulina,</line>
            <line>We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>That</line>
            <line>Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;</line>
            <line>Never till then.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter a Gentleman</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,</line>
            <line>Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she</line>
            <line>The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access</line>
            <line>To your high presence.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>What with him? he comes not</line>
            <line>Like to his father's greatness: his approach,</line>
            <line>So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us</line>
            <line>'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced</line>
            <line>By need and accident. What train?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>But few,</line>
            <line>And those but mean.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>His princess, say you, with him?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,</line>
            <line>That e'er the sun shone bright on.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>O Hermione,</line>
            <line>As every present time doth boast itself</line>
            <line>Above a better gone, so must thy grave</line>
            <line>Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself</line>
            <line>Have said and writ so, but your writing now</line>
            <line>Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,</line>
            <line>Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse</line>
            <line>Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,</line>
            <line>To say you have seen a better.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Pardon, madam:</line>
            <line>The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--</line>
            <line>The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,</line>
            <line>Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,</line>
            <line>Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal</line>
            <line>Of all professors else, make proselytes</line>
            <line>Of who she but bid follow.</line>
         </speech>

            <line>How! not women?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Women will love her, that she is a woman</line>
            <line>More worth than any man; men, that she is</line>
            <line>The rarest of all women.</line>

            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Go, Cleomenes;</line>
            <line>Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,</line>
            <line>Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange</line>
            <stagedir>Exeunt CLEOMENES and others</stagedir>
            <line>He thus should steal upon us.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>Had our prince,</line>
            <line>Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd</line>
            <line>Well with this lord: there was not full a month</line>
            <line>Between their births.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st</line>
            <line>He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,</line>
            <line>When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches</line>
            <line>Will bring me to consider that which may</line>
            <line>Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.</line>
            <stagedir>Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA</stagedir>
            <line>Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;</line>
            <line>For she did print your royal father off,</line>
            <line>Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,</line>
            <line>Your father's image is so hit in you,</line>
            <line>His very air, that I should call you brother,</line>
            <line>As I did him, and speak of something wildly</line>
            <line>By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!</line>
            <line>And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!</line>
            <line>I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth</line>
            <line>Might thus have stood begetting wonder as</line>
            <line>You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--</line>
            <line>All mine own folly--the society,</line>
            <line>Amity too, of your brave father, whom,</line>
            <line>Though bearing misery, I desire my life</line>
            <line>Once more to look on him.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
            <line>By his command</line>
            <line>Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him</line>
            <line>Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,</line>
            <line>Can send his brother: and, but infirmity</line>
            <line>Which waits upon worn times hath something seized</line>
            <line>His wish'd ability, he had himself</line>
            <line>The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his</line>
            <line>Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--</line>
            <line>He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>O my brother,</line>
            <line>Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir</line>
            <line>Afresh within me, and these thy offices,</line>
            <line>So rarely kind, are as interpreters</line>
            <line>Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,</line>
            <line>As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too</line>
            <line>Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,</line>
            <line>At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,</line>
            <line>To greet a man not worth her pains, much less</line>
            <line>The adventure of her person?</line>

            <line>Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter</line>

            <line>For visiting your highness: my best train</line>

            <line>So sacred as it is, I have done sin:</line>
            <line>For which the heavens, taking angry note,</line>
            <line>Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,</line>
            <line>As he from heaven merits it, with you</line>
            <line>Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,</line>
            <line>Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,</line>

            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old</line>
            <line>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:</line>
            <line>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all</line>
            <line>commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the</line>
            <line>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were</line>
            <line>very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with</line>
            <line>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their</line>
            <line>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language</line>
            <line>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</line>
            <line>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable</line>
            <line>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest</line>
            <line>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not</line>
            <line>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the</line>
            <line>extremity of the one, it must needs be.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter another Gentleman</stagedir>
            <line>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the</line>
            <line>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is</line>
            <line>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers</line>
            <line>cannot be able to express it.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter a third Gentleman</stagedir>
            <line>Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can</line>
            <line>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news</line>
            <line>which is called true is so like an old tale, that</line>
            <line>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</line>
            <line>found his heir?</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</line>
            <line>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</line>
            <line>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</line>
            <line>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</line>
            <line>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</line>
            <line>know to be his character, the majesty of the</line>
            <line>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</line>
            <line>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</line>
            <line>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</line>
            <line>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see</line>
            <line>the meeting of the two kings?</line>

            <line>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</line>
            <line>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</line>
            <line>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</line>
            <line>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</line>
            <line>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</line>
            <line>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</line>
            <line>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</line>
            <line>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</line>
            <line>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</line>
            <line>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</line>
            <line>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</line>
            <line>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</line>
            <line>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</line>
            <line>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</line>
            <line>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such</line>
            <line>another encounter, which lames report to follow it</line>
            <line>and undoes description to do it.</line>

            <line>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to</line>
            <line>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear</line>
            <line>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this</line>
            <line>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his</line>
            <line>innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a</line>
            <line>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and</line>
            <line>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the</line>
            <line>instruments which aided to expose the child were</line>
            <line>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble</line>
            <line>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</line>
            <line>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</line>
            <line>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</line>
            <line>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</line>
            <line>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</line>
            <line>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger</line>
            <line>of losing.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which</line>

            <line>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's</line>
            <line>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely</line>
            <line>confessed and lamented by the king, how</line>
            <line>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one</line>
            <line>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'</line>
            <line>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</line>
            <line>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed</line>
            <line>colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world</line>
            <line>could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.</line>

            <line>years in doing and now newly performed by that rare</line>

            <line>at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,</line>
            <line>so he then took her to be, who began to be much</line>
            <line>sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of</line>

            <line>undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I</line>

            <line>See you these clothes? say you see them not and</line>
            <line>think me still no gentleman born: you were best say</line>

            <line>What, sovereign sir,</line>
            <line>I did not well I meant well. All my services</line>
            <line>You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,</line>
            <line>With your crown'd brother and these your contracted</line>
            <line>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</line>
            <line>It is a surplus of your grace, which never</line>

            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>O Paulina,</line>
            <line>We honour you with trouble: but we came</line>
            <line>To see the statue of our queen: your gallery</line>
            <line>Have we pass'd through, not without much content</line>
            <line>In many singularities; but we saw not</line>
            <line>That which my daughter came to look upon,</line>
            <line>The statue of her mother.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>As she lived peerless,</line>
            <line>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</line>
            <line>Excels whatever yet you look'd upon</line>
            <line>Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it</line>
            <line>Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare</line>
            <line>To see the life as lively mock'd as ever</line>
            <line>Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.</line>
            <stagedir>PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE
standing like a statue</stagedir>
            <line>I like your silence, it the more shows off</line>
            <line>Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Her natural posture!</line>
            <line>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</line>
            <line>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</line>
            <line>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender</line>
            <line>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</line>
            <line>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</line>
            <line>So aged as this seems.</line>

            <line>So much the more our carver's excellence;</line>

            <line>So much to my good comfort, as it is</line>
            <line>Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</line>
            <line>Even with such life of majesty, warm life,</line>
            <line>As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!</line>
            <line>I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me</line>
            <line>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</line>
            <line>There's magic in thy majesty, which has</line>
            <line>My evils conjured to remembrance and</line>
            <line>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</line>
            <line>Standing like stone with thee.</line>

            <line>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</line>

            <line>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</line>

            <line>So many summers dry; scarce any joy</line>
            <line>Did ever so long live; no sorrow</line>

            <line>What was he that did make it? See, my lord,</line>
            <line>Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>I'll draw the curtain:</line>

            <line>No settled senses of the world can match</line>
            <line>The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.</line>

            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but</line>

            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Do, Paulina;</line>
            <line>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</line>
            <line>As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,</line>
            <line>There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel</line>
            <line>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</line>
            <line>For I will kiss her.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
            <line>Good my lord, forbear:</line>
            <line>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</line>
            <line>You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own</line>
            <line>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</line>

            <line>I'll make the statue move indeed, descend</line>

            <line>Start not; her actions shall be holy as</line>

            <line>But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,</line>
            <line>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many</line>
            <line>A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--</line>
            <line>For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee</line>
            <line>An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,</line>
            <line>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</line>
            <line>Is richly noted and here justified</line>
            <line>By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.</line>
            <line>What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,</line>
            <line>That e'er I put between your holy looks</line>
            <line>My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,</line>
            <line>And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,</line>

            <line>Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</line>
            <line>Each one demand an answer to his part</line>
            <line>Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first</line>
            <line>We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.</line>

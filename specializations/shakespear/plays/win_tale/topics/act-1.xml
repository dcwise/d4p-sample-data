            <line>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on</line>
            <line>the like occasion whereon my services are now on</line>
            <line>foot, you shall see, as I have said, great</line>
            <line>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</line>

            <line>I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia</line>
            <line>means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
            <line>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be</line>
            <line>justified in our loves; for indeed--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
            <line>Beseech you,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
            <line>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:</line>
            <line>we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know</line>
            <line>not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,</line>
            <line>that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,</line>
            <line>may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse</line>
            <line>us.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
            <line>You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
            <line>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me</line>
            <line>and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
            <line>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.</line>
            <line>They were trained together in their childhoods; and</line>
            <line>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,</line>
            <line>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their</line>
            <line>more mature dignities and royal necessities made</line>
            <line>separation of their society, their encounters,</line>
            <line>though not personal, have been royally attorneyed</line>
            <line>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving</line>
            <line>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,</line>
            <line>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and</line>
            <line>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed</line>
            <line>winds. The heavens continue their loves!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
            <line>I think there is not in the world either malice or</line>
            <line>matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable</line>
            <line>comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a</line>
            <line>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came</line>
            <line>into my note.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
            <line>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it</line>
            <line>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the</line>
            <line>subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on</line>
            <line>crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to</line>
            <line>see him a man.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
            <line>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should</line>
            <line>desire to live.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>

            <line>Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
            <line>We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,</line>
            <line>And bleat the one at the other: what we changed</line>
            <line>Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</line>
            <line>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd</line>
            <line>That any did. Had we pursued that life,</line>
            <line>And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd</line>
            <line>With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven</line>
            <line>Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd</line>
            <line>Hereditary ours.</line>

            <line>What! have I twice said well? when was't before?</line>
            <line>I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's</line>
            <line>As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless</line>
            <line>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</line>
            <line>Our praises are our wages: you may ride's</line>
            <line>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</line>
            <line>With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:</line>
            <line>My last good deed was to entreat his stay:</line>
            <line>What was my first? it has an elder sister,</line>
            <line>Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!</line>
            <line>But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?</line>
            <line>Nay, let me have't; I long.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
            <line>Why, that was when</line>
            <line>Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,</line>
            <line>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand</line>
            <line>And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter</line>

            <line>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:</line>
            <line>The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;</line>
            <line>The other for some while a friend.</line>

            <line>I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;</line>
            <line>But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment</line>
            <line>May a free face put on, derive a liberty</line>
            <line>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</line>
            <line>And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;</line>

            <line>Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't</line>

            <line>Who in rebellion with himself will have</line>
            <line>All that are his so too. To do this deed,</line>
            <line>Promotion follows. If I could find example</line>
            <line>Of thousands that had struck anointed kings</line>
            <line>And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since</line>
            <line>Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,</line>
            <line>Let villany itself forswear't. I must</line>

            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Now is the winter of our discontent</line>
            <line>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</line>
            <line>And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house</line>
            <line>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</line>
            <line>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</line>
            <line>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</line>
            <line>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</line>
            <line>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</line>
            <line>Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</line>
            <line>And now, instead of mounting barded steeds</line>
            <line>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</line>
            <line>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber</line>
            <line>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</line>
            <line>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</line>
            <line>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</line>
            <line>I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty</line>
            <line>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</line>
            <line>I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,</line>
            <line>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</line>
            <line>Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time</line>
            <line>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</line>
            <line>And that so lamely and unfashionable</line>
            <line>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</line>
            <line>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</line>
            <line>Have no delight to pass away the time,</line>
            <line>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</line>
            <line>And descant on mine own deformity:</line>
            <line>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</line>
            <line>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</line>
            <line>I am determined to prove a villain</line>
            <line>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</line>
            <line>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</line>
            <line>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</line>
            <line>To set my brother Clarence and the king</line>
            <line>In deadly hate the one against the other:</line>
            <line>And if King Edward be as true and just</line>
            <line>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</line>
            <line>This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,</line>
            <line>About a prophecy, which says that 'G'</line>
            <line>Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.</line>
            <line>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here</line>
            <line>Clarence comes.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</stagedir>
            <line>Brother, good day; what means this armed guard</line>
            <line>That waits upon your grace?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>His majesty</line>
            <line>Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed</line>
            <line>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Upon what cause?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>Because my name is George.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</line>
            <line>He should, for that, commit your godfathers:</line>
            <line>O, belike his majesty hath some intent</line>
            <line>That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.</line>
            <line>But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest</line>
            <line>As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,</line>
            <line>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;</line>
            <line>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.</line>
            <line>And says a wizard told him that by G</line>
            <line>His issue disinherited should be;</line>
            <line>And, for my name of George begins with G,</line>
            <line>It follows in his thought that I am he.</line>
            <line>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</line>
            <line>Have moved his highness to commit me now.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:</line>
            <line>'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:</line>
            <line>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she</line>
            <line>That tempers him to this extremity.</line>
            <line>Was it not she and that good man of worship,</line>
            <line>Anthony Woodville, her brother there,</line>
            <line>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</line>
            <line>From whence this present day he is deliver'd?</line>
            <line>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>By heaven, I think there's no man is secure</line>
            <line>But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds</line>
            <line>That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.</line>
            <line>Heard ye not what an humble suppliant</line>
            <line>Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Humbly complaining to her deity</line>
            <line>Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.</line>
            <line>I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,</line>
            <line>If we will keep in favour with the king,</line>
            <line>To be her men and wear her livery:</line>
            <line>The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,</line>
            <line>Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.</line>
            <line>Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
            <line>I beseech your graces both to pardon me;</line>
            <line>His majesty hath straitly given in charge</line>
            <line>That no man shall have private conference,</line>
            <line>Of what degree soever, with his brother.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,</line>
            <line>You may partake of any thing we say:</line>
            <line>We speak no treason, man: we say the king</line>
            <line>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</line>
            <line>Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</line>
            <line>We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,</line>
            <line>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</line>
            <line>And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:</line>
            <line>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
            <line>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,</line>
            <line>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,</line>
            <line>Were best he do it secretly, alone.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
            <line>What one, my lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
            <line>I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal</line>
            <line>Forbear your conference with the noble duke.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.</line>
            <line>Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;</line>
            <line>And whatsoever you will employ me in,</line>
            <line>Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,</line>
            <line>I will perform it to enfranchise you.</line>
            <line>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</line>
            <line>Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;</line>
            <line>Meantime, have patience.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
            <line>I must perforce. Farewell.</line>

            <line>Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.</line>
            <line>Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,</line>
            <line>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</line>
            <line>If heaven will take the present at our hands.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>As much unto my good lord chamberlain!</line>
            <line>Well are you welcome to the open air.</line>
            <line>How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:</line>
            <line>But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</line>
            <line>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;</line>
            <line>For they that were your enemies are his,</line>
            <line>And have prevail'd as much on him as you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,</line>
            <line>While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>What news abroad?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>No news so bad abroad as this at home;</line>
            <line>The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,</line>
            <line>And his physicians fear him mightily.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.</line>
            <line>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</line>
            <line>And overmuch consumed his royal person:</line>
            <line>'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</line>
            <line>What, is he in his bed?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>He is.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Go you before, and I will follow you.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit HASTINGS</stagedir>
            <line>He cannot live, I hope; and must not die</line>
            <line>Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.</line>
            <line>I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,</line>
            <line>With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;</line>
            <line>And, if I fall not in my deep intent,</line>
            <line>Clarence hath not another day to live:</line>
            <line>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</line>
            <line>And leave the world for me to bustle in!</line>
            <line>For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.</line>
            <line>What though I kill'd her husband and her father?</line>
            <line>The readiest way to make the wench amends</line>
            <line>Is to become her husband and her father:</line>
            <line>The which will I; not all so much for love</line>
            <line>As for another secret close intent,</line>
            <line>By marrying her which I must reach unto.</line>
            <line>But yet I run before my horse to market:</line>
            <line>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:</line>
            <line>When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</line>

            <line>Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,</line>

            <line>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,</line>
            <line>Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:</line>

            <line>No, when my father York and Edward wept,</line>

            <line>When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;</line>
            <line>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,</line>

            <line>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</line>

            <stagedir>He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword</stagedir>
            <line>Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,</line>

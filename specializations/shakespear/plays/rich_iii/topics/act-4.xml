            <line>Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!</line>
            <line>Anointed let me be with deadly venom,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
            <line>No! why?  When he that is my husband now</line>
            <line>Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,</line>
            <line>When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands</line>
            <line>Which issued from my other angel husband</line>
            <line>And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;</line>
            <line>O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,</line>
            <line>This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,</line>
            <line>For making me, so young, so old a widow!</line>
            <line>And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;</line>
            <line>And be thy wife--if any be so mad--</line>
            <line>As miserable by the life of thee</line>
            <line>As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!</line>
            <line>Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,</line>
            <line>Even in so short a space, my woman's heart</line>
            <line>Grossly grew captive to his honey words</line>
            <line>And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,</line>
            <line>Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;</line>
            <line>For never yet one hour in his bed</line>
            <line>Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,</line>
            <line>But have been waked by his timorous dreams.</line>
            <line>Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;</line>
            <line>And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.</line>

            <line>For joyful mother, one that wails the name;</line>
            <line>For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;</line>

            <line>A grandam's name is little less in love</line>

            <line>The loss you have is but a son being king,</line>

            <line>I cannot make you what amends I would,</line>
            <line>Therefore accept such kindness as I can.</line>
            <line>Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul</line>

            <line>Repair'd with double riches of content.</line>
            <line>What! we have many goodly days to see:</line>
            <line>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed</line>
            <line>Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,</line>
            <line>Advantaging their loan with interest</line>
            <line>Of ten times double gain of happiness.</line>

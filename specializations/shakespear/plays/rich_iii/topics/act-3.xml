         <stagedir>The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD,
GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign</line>
            <line>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
            <line>No, uncle; but our crosses on the way</line>
            <line>Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy</line>
            <line>I want more uncles here to welcome me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years</line>
            <line>Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit</line>
            <line>Nor more can you distinguish of a man</line>
            <line>Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,</line>
            <line>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</line>
            <line>Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</line>
            <line>Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,</line>
            <line>But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :</line>
            <line>God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
            <line>God keep me from false friends! but they were none.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter the Lord Mayor and his train</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
            <line>God bless your grace with health and happy days!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
            <line>I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.</line>
            <line>I thought my mother, and my brother York,</line>
            <line>Would long ere this have met us on the way</line>
            <line>Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not</line>
            <line>To tell us whether they will come or no!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter HASTINGS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
            <line>Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,</line>
            <line>The queen your mother, and your brother York,</line>
            <line>Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince</line>
            <line>Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,</line>
            <line>But by his mother was perforce withheld.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</line>
            <line>Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace</line>
            <line>Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York</line>
            <line>Unto his princely brother presently?</line>
            <line>If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</line>
            <line>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL</speaker>
            <line>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</line>
            <line>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</line>
            <line>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</line>
            <line>To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</line>
            <line>We should infringe the holy privilege</line>
            <line>Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land</line>
            <line>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,</line>
            <line>Too ceremonious and traditional</line>
            <line>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</line>
            <line>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</line>
            <line>The benefit thereof is always granted</line>
            <line>To those whose dealings have deserved the place,</line>
            <line>And those who have the wit to claim the place:</line>
            <line>This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;</line>
            <line>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:</line>
            <line>Then, taking him from thence that is not there,</line>
            <line>You break no privilege nor charter there.</line>
            <line>Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;</line>
            <line>But sanctuary children ne'er till now.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL</speaker>
            <line>My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.</line>
            <line>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>I go, my lord.</line>

            <line>Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.</line>
            <stagedir>Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS</stagedir>
            <line>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</line>
            <line>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Where it seems best unto your royal self.</line>
            <line>If I may counsel you, some day or two</line>
            <line>Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:</line>
            <line>Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit</line>
            <line>For your best health and recreation.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
            <line>I do not like the Tower, of any place.</line>
            <line>Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;</line>
            <line>Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
            <line>Is it upon record, or else reported</line>
            <line>Successively from age to age, he built it?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>Upon record, my gracious lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
            <line>But say, my lord, it were not register'd,</line>
            <line>Methinks the truth should live from age to age,</line>
            <line>As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,</line>
            <line>Even to the general all-ending day.</line>

            <line>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:</line>
            <line>Too late he died that might have kept that title,</line>
            <line>Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</line>

            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>I do suspect I have done some offence</line>
            <line>That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,</line>
            <line>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</line>

            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,</line>
            <line>At our entreaties, to amend that fault!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>Then know, it is your fault that you resign</line>
            <line>The supreme seat, the throne majestical,</line>
            <line>The scepter'd office of your ancestors,</line>
            <line>Your state of fortune and your due of birth,</line>
            <line>The lineal glory of your royal house,</line>
            <line>To the corruption of a blemished stock:</line>
            <line>Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</line>
            <line>Which here we waken to our country's good,</line>
            <line>This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;</line>
            <line>Her face defaced with scars of infamy,</line>
            <line>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</line>
            <line>And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf</line>
            <line>Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.</line>
            <line>Which to recure, we heartily solicit</line>
            <line>Your gracious self to take on you the charge</line>
            <line>And kingly government of this your land,</line>
            <line>Not as protector, steward, substitute,</line>
            <line>Or lowly factor for another's gain;</line>
            <line>But as successively from blood to blood,</line>
            <line>Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</line>
            <line>For this, consorted with the citizens,</line>
            <line>Your very worshipful and loving friends,</line>
            <line>And by their vehement instigation,</line>
            <line>In this just suit come I to move your grace.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>I know not whether to depart in silence,</line>
            <line>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.</line>
            <line>Best fitteth my degree or your condition</line>
            <line>If not to answer, you might haply think</line>
            <line>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</line>
            <line>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</line>
            <line>Which fondly you would here impose on me;</line>
            <line>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</line>
            <line>So season'd with your faithful love to me.</line>
            <line>Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.</line>
            <line>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</line>
            <line>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</line>
            <line>Definitively thus I answer you.</line>
            <line>Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert</line>
            <line>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</line>
            <line>First if all obstacles were cut away,</line>
            <line>And that my path were even to the crown,</line>
            <line>As my ripe revenue and due by birth</line>
            <line>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</line>
            <line>So mighty and so many my defects,</line>
            <line>As I had rather hide me from my greatness,</line>
            <line>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,</line>
            <line>Than in my greatness covet to be hid,</line>
            <line>And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.</line>
            <line>But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,</line>
            <line>And much I need to help you, if need were;</line>
            <line>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</line>
            <line>Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,</line>
            <line>Will well become the seat of majesty,</line>
            <line>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</line>
            <line>On him I lay what you would lay on me,</line>
            <line>The right and fortune of his happy stars;</line>
            <line>Which God defend that I should wring from him!</line>

            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;</line>
            <line>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</line>
            <line>All circumstances well considered.</line>
            <line>You say that Edward is your brother's son:</line>
            <line>So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;</line>
            <line>For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--</line>
            <line>Your mother lives a witness to that vow--</line>
            <line>And afterward by substitute betroth'd</line>
            <line>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</line>
            <line>These both put by a poor petitioner,</line>
            <line>A care-crazed mother of a many children,</line>
            <line>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</line>
            <line>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</line>
            <line>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</line>
            <line>Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</line>
            <line>To base declension and loathed bigamy</line>
            <line>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</line>
            <line>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</line>
            <line>More bitterly could I expostulate,</line>
            <line>Save that, for reverence to some alive,</line>
            <line>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</line>
            <line>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</line>
            <line>This proffer'd benefit of dignity;</line>
            <line>If non to bless us and the land withal,</line>
            <line>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</line>
            <line>From the corruption of abusing times,</line>
            <line>Unto a lineal true-derived course.</line>

            <line>Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?</line>
            <line>I am unfit for state and majesty;</line>
            <line>I do beseech you, take it not amiss;</line>

            <line>If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,</line>
            <line>Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;</line>
            <line>As well we know your tenderness of heart</line>
            <line>And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,</line>

            <line>And egally indeed to all estates,--</line>

            <line>Your brother's son shall never reign our king;</line>
            <line>But we will plant some other in the throne,</line>
            <line>To the disgrace and downfall of your house:</line>

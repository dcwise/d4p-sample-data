            <line>Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:</line>

            <line>A thing devised by the enemy.</line>
            <line>Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge</line>
            <line>Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:</line>
            <line>Conscience is but a word that cowards use,</line>
            <line>Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:</line>
            <line>Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.</line>

            <line>Remember whom you are to cope withal;</line>
            <line>A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,</line>
            <line>A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,</line>
            <line>Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth</line>

            <line>You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;</line>
            <line>You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,</line>
            <line>They would restrain the one, distain the other.</line>
            <line>And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,</line>
            <line>Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?</line>
            <line>A milk-sop, one that never in his life</line>
            <line>Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?</line>
            <line>Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;</line>
            <line>Lash hence these overweening rags of France,</line>
            <line>These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;</line>
            <line>Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,</line>
            <line>For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:</line>
            <line>If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,</line>
            <line>And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers</line>
            <line>Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,</line>
            <line>And in record, left them the heirs of shame.</line>
            <line>Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?</line>

            <line>Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:</line>
            <line>You peers, continue this united league:</line>
            <line>I every day expect an embassage</line>
            <line>From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;</line>
            <line>And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,</line>
            <line>Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.</line>
            <line>Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;</line>

            <line>Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;</line>
            <line>You have been factious one against the other,</line>
            <line>Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;</line>
            <line>And what you do, do it unfeignedly.</line>

            <line>On you or yours,</line>
            <stagedir>To the Queen</stagedir>
            <line>but with all duteous love</line>
            <line>Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me</line>
            <line>With hate in those where I expect most love!</line>
            <line>When I have most need to employ a friend,</line>
            <line>And most assured that he is a friend</line>
            <line>Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,</line>
            <line>Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,</line>
            <line>When I am cold in zeal to yours.</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.</line>
            <line>Brother, we done deeds of charity;</line>
            <line>Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,</line>
            <line>Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:</line>
            <line>Amongst this princely heap, if any here,</line>
            <line>By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,</line>
            <line>Hold me a foe;</line>
            <line>If I unwittingly, or in my rage,</line>
            <line>Have aught committed that is hardly borne</line>
            <line>By any in this presence, I desire</line>
            <line>To reconcile me to his friendly peace:</line>
            <line>'Tis death to me to be at enmity;</line>
            <line>I hate it, and desire all good men's love.</line>
            <line>First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,</line>
            <line>Which I will purchase with my duteous service;</line>
            <line>Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,</line>
            <line>If ever any grudge were lodged between us;</line>
            <line>Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;</line>
            <line>That without desert have frown'd on me;</line>
            <line>Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.</line>
            <line>I do not know that Englishman alive</line>
            <line>With whom my soul is any jot at odds</line>
            <line>More than the infant that is born to-night</line>
            <line>I thank my God for my humility.</line>

            <line>My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty</line>

            <line>To be so bouted in this royal presence?</line>
            <line>Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?</line>

            <line>Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence</line>
            <line>But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.</line>

            <speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
            <line>Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>But he, poor soul, by your first order died,</line>

            <line>Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,</line>
            <line>That came too lag to see him buried.</line>
            <line>God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,</line>
            <line>Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,</line>
            <line>Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,</line>

            <line>The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;</line>

            <line>Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,</line>
            <line>And shall the same give pardon to a slave?</line>
            <line>My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,</line>
            <line>And yet his punishment was cruel death.</line>
            <line>Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,</line>
            <line>Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised</line>
            <line>Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?</line>
            <line>Who told me how the poor soul did forsake</line>
            <line>The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?</line>
            <line>Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury</line>
            <line>When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,</line>
            <line>And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?</line>
            <line>Who told me, when we both lay in the field</line>
            <line>Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me</line>
            <line>Even in his own garments, and gave himself,</line>
            <line>All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?</line>
            <line>All this from my remembrance brutish wrath</line>
            <line>Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you</line>
            <line>Had so much grace to put it in my mind.</line>
            <line>But when your carters or your waiting-vassals</line>
            <line>Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced</line>
            <line>The precious image of our dear Redeemer,</line>
            <line>You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;</line>
            <line>And I unjustly too, must grant it you</line>
            <line>But for my brother not a man would speak,</line>
            <line>Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself</line>
            <line>For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all</line>
            <line>Have been beholding to him in his life;</line>
            <line>Yet none of you would once plead for his life.</line>
            <line>O God, I fear thy justice will take hold</line>

            <line>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow</line>

            <line>And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,</line>
            <line>Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,</line>
            <line>Thine being but a moiety of my grief,</line>

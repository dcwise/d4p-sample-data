         <stagedir>Enter BRUTUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>What, Lucius, ho!</line>
            <line>I cannot, by the progress of the stars,</line>
            <line>Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!</line>
            <line>I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.</line>
            <line>When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter LUCIUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Call'd you, my lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:</line>
            <line>When it is lighted, come and call me here.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>I will, my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>It must be by his death: and for my part,</line>
            <line>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</line>
            <line>But for the general. He would be crown'd:</line>
            <line>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</line>
            <line>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</line>
            <line>And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--</line>
            <line>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,</line>
            <line>That at his will he may do danger with.</line>
            <line>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</line>
            <line>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</line>
            <line>I have not known when his affections sway'd</line>
            <line>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,</line>
            <line>That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</line>
            <line>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</line>
            <line>But when he once attains the upmost round.</line>
            <line>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</line>
            <line>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</line>
            <line>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</line>
            <line>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</line>
            <line>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</line>
            <line>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</line>
            <line>Would run to these and these extremities:</line>
            <line>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</line>
            <line>Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,</line>
            <line>And kill him in the shell.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Re-enter LUCIUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>The taper burneth in your closet, sir.</line>
            <line>Searching the window for a flint, I found</line>
            <line>This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,</line>
            <line>It did not lie there when I went to bed.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Gives him the letter</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Get you to bed again; it is not day.</line>
            <line>Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>I know not, sir.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Look in the calendar, and bring me word.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>I will, sir.</line>

         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>The exhalations whizzing in the air</line>
            <line>Give so much light that I may read by them.</line>
            <stagedir>Opens the letter and reads</stagedir>
            <line>'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.</line>
            <line>Shall Rome, &amp;c. Speak, strike, redress!</line>
            <line>Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'</line>
            <line>Such instigations have been often dropp'd</line>
            <line>Where I have took them up.</line>
            <line>'Shall Rome, &amp;c.' Thus must I piece it out:</line>
            <line>Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?</line>
            <line>My ancestors did from the streets of Rome</line>
            <line>The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.</line>
            <line>'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated</line>
            <line>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:</line>
            <line>If the redress will follow, thou receivest</line>
            <line>Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Re-enter LUCIUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Knocking within</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit LUCIUS</stagedir>
            <line>Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,</line>
            <line>I have not slept.</line>
            <line>Between the acting of a dreadful thing</line>
            <line>And the first motion, all the interim is</line>
            <line>Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:</line>
            <line>The Genius and the mortal instruments</line>
            <line>Are then in council; and the state of man,</line>
            <line>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</line>
            <line>The nature of an insurrection.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Re-enter LUCIUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,</line>
            <line>Who doth desire to see you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Is he alone?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>No, sir, there are moe with him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Do you know them?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
            <line>No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,</line>
            <line>And half their faces buried in their cloaks,</line>
            <line>That by no means I may discover them</line>
            <line>By any mark of favour.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Let 'em enter.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit LUCIUS</stagedir>
            <line>They are the faction. O conspiracy,</line>
            <line>Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,</line>
            <line>When evils are most free? O, then by day</line>
            <line>Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough</line>
            <line>To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;</line>
            <line>Hide it in smiles and affability:</line>
            <line>For if thou path, thy native semblance on,</line>
            <line>Not Erebus itself were dim enough</line>
            <line>To hide thee from prevention.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS
BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>I think we are too bold upon your rest:</line>
            <line>Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>I have been up this hour, awake all night.</line>
            <line>Know I these men that come along with you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Yes, every man of them, and no man here</line>
            <line>But honours you; and every one doth wish</line>
            <line>You had but that opinion of yourself</line>
            <line>Which every noble Roman bears of you.</line>
            <line>This is Trebonius.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>He is welcome hither.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>This, Decius Brutus.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>He is welcome too.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>They are all welcome.</line>
            <line>What watchful cares do interpose themselves</line>
            <line>Betwixt your eyes and night?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Shall I entreat a word?</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASCA</speaker>
            <line>No.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CINNA</speaker>
            <line>O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines</line>
            <line>That fret the clouds are messengers of day.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASCA</speaker>
            <line>You shall confess that you are both deceived.</line>
            <line>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</line>
            <line>Which is a great way growing on the south,</line>
            <line>Weighing the youthful season of the year.</line>
            <line>Some two months hence up higher toward the north</line>
            <line>He first presents his fire; and the high east</line>
            <line>Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Give me your hands all over, one by one.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>And let us swear our resolution.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>No, not an oath: if not the face of men,</line>
            <line>The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--</line>
            <line>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</line>
            <line>And every man hence to his idle bed;</line>
            <line>So let high-sighted tyranny range on,</line>
            <line>Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,</line>
            <line>As I am sure they do, bear fire enough</line>
            <line>To kindle cowards and to steel with valour</line>
            <line>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,</line>
            <line>What need we any spur but our own cause,</line>
            <line>To prick us to redress? what other bond</line>
            <line>Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,</line>
            <line>And will not palter? and what other oath</line>
            <line>Than honesty to honesty engaged,</line>
            <line>That this shall be, or we will fall for it?</line>
            <line>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,</line>
            <line>Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls</line>
            <line>That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear</line>
            <line>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain</line>
            <line>The even virtue of our enterprise,</line>
            <line>Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,</line>
            <line>To think that or our cause or our performance</line>
            <line>Did need an oath; when every drop of blood</line>
            <line>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</line>
            <line>Is guilty of a several bastardy,</line>
            <line>If he do break the smallest particle</line>
            <line>Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?</line>
            <line>I think he will stand very strong with us.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASCA</speaker>
            <line>Let us not leave him out.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CINNA</speaker>
            <line>No, by no means.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>METELLUS CIMBER</speaker>
            <line>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</line>
            <line>Will purchase us a good opinion</line>
            <line>And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:</line>
            <line>It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;</line>
            <line>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,</line>
            <line>But all be buried in his gravity.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>O, name him not: let us not break with him;</line>
            <line>For he will never follow any thing</line>
            <line>That other men begin.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Then leave him out.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASCA</speaker>
            <line>Indeed he is not fit.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,</line>
            <line>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</line>
            <line>Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him</line>
            <line>A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,</line>
            <line>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</line>
            <line>As to annoy us all: which to prevent,</line>
            <line>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</line>
            <line>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,</line>
            <line>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</line>
            <line>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:</line>
            <line>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</line>
            <line>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;</line>
            <line>And in the spirit of men there is no blood:</line>
            <line>O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</line>
            <line>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</line>
            <line>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</line>
            <line>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</line>
            <line>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</line>
            <line>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:</line>
            <line>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</line>
            <line>Stir up their servants to an act of rage,</line>
            <line>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make</line>
            <line>Our purpose necessary and not envious:</line>
            <line>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</line>
            <line>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</line>
            <line>And for Mark Antony, think not of him;</line>
            <line>For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</line>
            <line>When Caesar's head is off.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Yet I fear him;</line>
            <line>For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</line>

            <line>In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</line>
            <line>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</line>

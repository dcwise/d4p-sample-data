            <line>Prick him down, Antony.</line>

            <speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
            <line>Upon condition Publius shall not live,</line>

            <line>He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.</line>
            <line>But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;</line>
            <line>Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine</line>

            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>This is a slight unmeritable man,</line>
            <line>Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,</line>
            <line>The three-fold world divided, he should stand</line>
            <line>One of the three to share it?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>So you thought him;</line>
            <line>And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,</line>
            <line>In our black sentence and proscription.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>Octavius, I have seen more days than you:</line>
            <line>And though we lay these honours on this man,</line>
            <line>To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</line>
            <line>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</line>
            <line>To groan and sweat under the business,</line>
            <line>Either led or driven, as we point the way;</line>
            <line>And having brought our treasure where we will,</line>
            <line>Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</line>
            <line>Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</line>
            <line>And graze in commons.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>You may do your will;</line>
            <line>But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>So is my horse, Octavius; and for that</line>
            <line>I do appoint him store of provender:</line>
            <line>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</line>
            <line>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</line>
            <line>His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</line>
            <line>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;</line>
            <line>He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;</line>
            <line>A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds</line>
            <line>On abjects, orts and imitations,</line>
            <line>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</line>
            <line>Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,</line>
            <line>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</line>
            <line>Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius</line>
            <line>Are levying powers: we must straight make head:</line>
            <line>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</line>
            <line>Our best friends made, our means stretch'd</line>
            <line>And let us presently go sit in council,</line>
            <line>How covert matters may be best disclosed,</line>
            <line>And open perils surest answered.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>Let us do so: for we are at the stake,</line>
            <line>And bay'd about with many enemies;</line>
            <line>And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,</line>

            <line>There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;</line>

            <line>That they pass by me as the idle wind,</line>
            <line>Which I respect not. I did send to you</line>

            <line>To you for gold to pay my legions,</line>
            <line>Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?</line>
            <line>Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?</line>
            <line>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,</line>

            <line>Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;</line>
            <line>Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,</line>
            <line>Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,</line>
            <line>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</line>
            <line>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</line>
            <line>And here my naked breast; within, a heart</line>
            <line>Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:</line>
            <line>If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;</line>
            <line>I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:</line>

            <line>When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better</line>

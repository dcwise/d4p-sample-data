            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:</line>
            <line>You said the enemy would not come down,</line>
            <line>But keep the hills and upper regions;</line>
            <line>It proves not so: their battles are at hand;</line>
            <line>They mean to warn us at Philippi here,</line>
            <line>Answering before we do demand of them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know</line>
            <line>Wherefore they do it: they could be content</line>
            <line>To visit other places; and come down</line>
            <line>With fearful bravery, thinking by this face</line>
            <line>To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;</line>
            <line>But 'tis not so.</line>
         </speech>

            <line>Prepare you, generals:</line>
            <line>The enemy comes on in gallant show;</line>
            <line>Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,</line>
            <line>And something to be done immediately.</line>

            <line>Octavius, lead your battle softly on,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>

            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>They stand, and would have parley.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.</line>
            <line>Make forth; the generals would have some words.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>Stir not until the signal.</line>

            <line>Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>Not that we love words better, as you do.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:</line>
            <line>Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,</line>
            <line>Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Antony,</line>
            <line>The posture of your blows are yet unknown;</line>
            <line>But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,</line>
            <line>And leave them honeyless.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>Not stingless too.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>O, yes, and soundless too;</line>
            <line>For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,</line>
            <line>And very wisely threat before you sting.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers</line>
            <line>Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:</line>
            <line>You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,</line>
            <line>And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;</line>
            <line>Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind</line>
            <line>Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:</line>
            <line>This tongue had not offended so to-day,</line>
            <line>If Cassius might have ruled.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,</line>
            <line>The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;</line>
            <line>I draw a sword against conspirators;</line>
            <line>When think you that the sword goes up again?</line>
            <line>Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds</line>
            <line>Be well avenged; or till another Caesar</line>
            <line>Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,</line>
            <line>Unless thou bring'st them with thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>So I hope;</line>
            <line>I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,</line>
            <line>Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,</line>
            <line>Join'd with a masker and a reveller!</line>

            <line>Come, Antony, away!</line>
            <line>Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:</line>
            <line>If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;</line>

            <line>The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Messala,</line>
            <line>This is my birth-day; as this very day</line>
            <line>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:</line>
            <line>Be thou my witness that against my will,</line>
            <line>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</line>
            <line>Upon one battle all our liberties.</line>
            <line>You know that I held Epicurus strong</line>
            <line>And his opinion: now I change my mind,</line>
            <line>And partly credit things that do presage.</line>
            <line>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</line>
            <line>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</line>
            <line>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;</line>
            <line>Who to Philippi here consorted us:</line>
            <line>This morning are they fled away and gone;</line>
            <line>And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,</line>
            <line>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</line>
            <line>As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem</line>
            <line>A canopy most fatal, under which</line>
            <line>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
            <line>Believe not so.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>I but believe it partly;</line>
            <line>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved</line>
            <line>To meet all perils very constantly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Even so, Lucilius.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Now, most noble Brutus,</line>
            <line>The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,</line>
            <line>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</line>
            <line>But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,</line>
            <line>Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</line>
            <line>If we do lose this battle, then is this</line>
            <line>The very last time we shall speak together:</line>
            <line>What are you then determined to do?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Even by the rule of that philosophy</line>
            <line>By which I did blame Cato for the death</line>
            <line>Which he did give himself, I know not how,</line>
            <line>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</line>
            <line>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</line>
            <line>The time of life: arming myself with patience</line>
            <line>To stay the providence of some high powers</line>
            <line>That govern us below.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>Then, if we lose this battle,</line>
            <line>You are contented to be led in triumph</line>
            <line>Thorough the streets of Rome?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,</line>
            <line>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</line>
            <line>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</line>
            <line>Must end that work the ides of March begun;</line>
            <line>And whether we shall meet again I know not.</line>
            <line>Therefore our everlasting farewell take:</line>
            <line>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!</line>
            <line>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</line>
            <line>If not, why then, this parting was well made.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
            <line>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!</line>
            <line>If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;</line>
            <line>If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
            <line>Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know</line>
            <line>The end of this day's business ere it come!</line>
            <line>But it sufficeth that the day will end,</line>
            <line>And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!</line>

            <line>I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:</line>
            <line>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</line>
            <line>Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:</line>
            <line>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</line>
            <line>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>STRATO</speaker>
            <line>Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.</line>

            <line>Caesar, now be still:</line>
            <line>I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.</line>

         <stagedir>Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA,
LUCILIUS, and the army</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>What man is that?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
            <line>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>STRATO</speaker>
            <line>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</line>
            <line>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</line>
            <line>For Brutus only overcame himself,</line>
            <line>And no man else hath honour by his death.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
            <line>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</line>
            <line>That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.</line>
            <line>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>STRATO</speaker>
            <line>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>Do so, good Messala.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
            <line>How died my master, Strato?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>STRATO</speaker>
            <line>I held the sword, and he did run on it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
            <line>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,</line>
            <line>That did the latest service to my master.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
            <line>This was the noblest Roman of them all:</line>
            <line>All the conspirators save only he</line>
            <line>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</line>
            <line>He only, in a general honest thought</line>
            <line>And common good to all, made one of them.</line>
            <line>His life was gentle, and the elements</line>
            <line>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</line>
            <line>And say to all the world 'This was a man!'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>According to his virtue let us use him,</line>
            <line>With all respect and rites of burial.</line>
            <line>Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,</line>
            <line>Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.</line>
            <line>So call the field to rest; and let's away,</line>
            <line>To part the glories of this happy day.</line>

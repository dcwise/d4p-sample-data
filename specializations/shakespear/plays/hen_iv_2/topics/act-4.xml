            <line>My friends and brethren in these great affairs,</line>
            <line>I must acquaint you that I have received</line>
            <line>New-dated letters from Northumberland;</line>
            <line>Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:</line>
            <line>Here doth he wish his person, with such powers</line>
            <line>As might hold sortance with his quality,</line>
            <line>The which he could not levy; whereupon</line>
            <line>He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,</line>
            <line>To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers</line>
            <line>That your attempts may overlive the hazard</line>
            <line>And fearful melting of their opposite.</line>

            <line>In goodly form comes on the enemy;</line>

            <line>Health and fair greeting from our general,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
            <line>Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:</line>
            <line>What doth concern your coming?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
            <line>Then, my lord,</line>
            <line>Unto your grace do I in chief address</line>
            <line>The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</line>
            <line>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</line>
            <line>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,</line>
            <line>And countenanced by boys and beggary,</line>
            <line>I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,</line>
            <line>In his true, native and most proper shape,</line>
            <line>You, reverend father, and these noble lords</line>
            <line>Had not been here, to dress the ugly form</line>
            <line>Of base and bloody insurrection</line>
            <line>With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,</line>
            <line>Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,</line>
            <line>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,</line>
            <line>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,</line>
            <line>Whose white investments figure innocence,</line>
            <line>The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,</line>
            <line>Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself</line>
            <line>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</line>
            <line>Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;</line>
            <line>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</line>
            <line>Your pens to lances and your tongue divine</line>
            <line>To a trumpet and a point of war?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
            <line>Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.</line>
            <line>Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,</line>
            <line>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</line>
            <line>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</line>
            <line>And we must bleed for it; of which disease</line>
            <line>Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.</line>
            <line>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</line>
            <line>I take not on me here as a physician,</line>
            <line>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</line>
            <line>Troop in the throngs of military men;</line>
            <line>But rather show awhile like fearful war,</line>
            <line>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</line>
            <line>And purge the obstructions which begin to stop</line>
            <line>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</line>
            <line>I have in equal balance justly weigh'd</line>
            <line>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</line>
            <line>And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</line>
            <line>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</line>
            <line>And are enforced from our most quiet there</line>
            <line>By the rough torrent of occasion;</line>
            <line>And have the summary of all our griefs,</line>
            <line>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</line>
            <line>Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,</line>
            <line>And might by no suit gain our audience:</line>
            <line>When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,</line>
            <line>We are denied access unto his person</line>
            <line>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</line>
            <line>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</line>
            <line>Whose memory is written on the earth</line>
            <line>With yet appearing blood, and the examples</line>
            <line>Of every minute's instance, present now,</line>
            <line>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</line>
            <line>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</line>
            <line>But to establish here a peace indeed,</line>
            <line>Concurring both in name and quality.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
            <line>When ever yet was your appeal denied?</line>
            <line>Wherein have you been galled by the king?</line>
            <line>What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,</line>
            <line>That you should seal this lawless bloody book</line>
            <line>Of forged rebellion with a seal divine</line>
            <line>And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
            <line>My brother general, the commonwealth,</line>
            <line>To brother born an household cruelty,</line>
            <line>I make my quarrel in particular.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
            <line>There is no need of any such redress;</line>
            <line>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>Why not to him in part, and to us all</line>
            <line>That feel the bruises of the days before,</line>
            <line>And suffer the condition of these times</line>
            <line>To lay a heavy and unequal hand</line>
            <line>Upon our honours?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
            <line>O, my good Lord Mowbray,</line>
            <line>Construe the times to their necessities,</line>
            <line>And you shall say indeed, it is the time,</line>
            <line>And not the king, that doth you injuries.</line>
            <line>Yet for your part, it not appears to me</line>
            <line>Either from the king or in the present time</line>
            <line>That you should have an inch of any ground</line>
            <line>To build a grief on: were you not restored</line>
            <line>To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,</line>
            <line>Your noble and right well remember'd father's?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>What thing, in honour, had my father lost,</line>
            <line>That need to be revived and breathed in me?</line>
            <line>The king that loved him, as the state stood then,</line>
            <line>Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:</line>
            <line>And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,</line>
            <line>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</line>
            <line>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</line>
            <line>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</line>
            <line>Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel</line>
            <line>And the loud trumpet blowing them together,</line>
            <line>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd</line>
            <line>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</line>
            <line>O when the king did throw his warder down,</line>
            <line>His own life hung upon the staff he threw;</line>
            <line>Then threw he down himself and all their lives</line>
            <line>That by indictment and by dint of sword</line>
            <line>Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
            <line>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</line>
            <line>The Earl of Hereford was reputed then</line>
            <line>In England the most valiant gentlemen:</line>
            <line>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?</line>
            <line>But if your father had been victor there,</line>
            <line>He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:</line>
            <line>For all the country in a general voice</line>
            <line>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</line>
            <line>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on</line>
            <line>And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.</line>
            <line>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</line>
            <line>Here come I from our princely general</line>
            <line>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace</line>
            <line>That he will give you audience; and wherein</line>
            <line>It shall appear that your demands are just,</line>
            <line>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off</line>
            <line>That might so much as think you enemies.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>But he hath forced us to compel this offer;</line>
            <line>And it proceeds from policy, not love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
            <line>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</line>
            <line>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:</line>
            <line>For, lo! within a ken our army lies,</line>
            <line>Upon mine honour, all too confident</line>
            <line>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</line>
            <line>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</line>
            <line>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</line>
            <line>Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;</line>
            <line>Then reason will our heart should be as good</line>
            <line>Say you not then our offer is compell'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</line>

            <line>In very ample virtue of his father,</line>
            <line>To hear and absolutely to determine</line>

            <line>To us and to our purposes confined,</line>
            <line>We come within our awful banks again</line>
            <line>And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WESTMORELAND</speaker>
            <line>This will I show the general. Please you, lords,</line>
            <line>In sight of both our battles we may meet;</line>
            <line>And either end in peace, which God so frame!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MOWBRAY</speaker>
            <line>Yea, but our valuation shall be such</line>

            <line>Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason</line>
            <line>Shall to the king taste of this action;</line>
            <line>That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,</line>
            <line>We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind</line>
            <line>That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff</line>
            <line>And good from bad find no partition.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
            <line>No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary</line>
            <line>Of dainty and such picking grievances:</line>
            <line>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</line>
            <line>Revives two greater in the heirs of life,</line>
            <line>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</line>
            <line>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</line>
            <line>That may repeat and history his loss</line>
            <line>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</line>
            <line>He cannot so precisely weed this land</line>
            <line>As his misdoubts present occasion:</line>
            <line>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</line>
            <line>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</line>
            <line>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:</line>
            <line>So that this land, like an offensive wife</line>
            <line>That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,</line>
            <line>As he is striking, holds his infant up</line>
            <line>And hangs resolved correction in the arm</line>
            <line>That was uprear'd to execution.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
            <line>Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods</line>
            <line>On late offenders, that he now doth lack</line>
            <line>The very instruments of chastisement:</line>
            <line>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</line>

            <line>I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than</line>
            <line>your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-</line>
            <line>blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make</line>
            <line>him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.</line>
            <line>There's never none of these demure boys come to any</line>
            <line>proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,</line>
            <line>and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a</line>
            <line>kind of male green-sickness; and then when they</line>
            <line>marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools</line>
            <line>and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for</line>
            <line>inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold</line>
            <line>operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;</line>
            <line>dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy</line>
            <line>vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,</line>
            <line>quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and</line>
            <line>delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the</line>
            <line>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes</line>
            <line>excellent wit. The second property of your</line>
            <line>excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;</line>
            <line>which, before cold and settled, left the liver</line>
            <line>white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity</line>
            <line>and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes</line>
            <line>it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:</line>
            <line>it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives</line>
            <line>warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,</line>
            <line>man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and</line>
            <line>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,</line>
            <line>the heart, who, great and puffed up with this</line>
            <line>retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour</line>
            <line>comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is</line>
            <line>nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and</line>
            <line>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till</line>
            <line>sack commences it and sets it in act and use.</line>
            <line>Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for</line>
            <line>the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his</line>
            <line>father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,</line>
            <line>manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent</line>
            <line>endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile</line>
            <line>sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If</line>
            <line>I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I</line>
            <line>would teach them should be, to forswear thin</line>
            <line>potations and to addict themselves to sack.</line>

            <line>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;</line>
            <line>Thou hast a better place in his affection</line>
            <line>Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,</line>
            <line>And noble offices thou mayst effect</line>
            <line>Of mediation, after I am dead,</line>
            <line>Between his greatness and thy other brethren:</line>
            <line>Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,</line>
            <line>Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</line>
            <line>By seeming cold or careless of his will;</line>
            <line>For he is gracious, if he be observed:</line>

            <line>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more</line>

            <line>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</line>
            <line>Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</line>

            <line>God witness with me, when I here came in,</line>
            <line>And found no course of breath within your majesty,</line>
            <line>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</line>

            <line>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</line>
            <line>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</line>
            <line>I spake unto this crown as having sense,</line>
            <line>And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending</line>
            <line>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</line>
            <line>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:</line>

            <line>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</line>
            <line>Did with the least affection of a welcome</line>
            <line>Give entertainment to the might of it,</line>
            <line>Let God for ever keep it from my head</line>
            <line>And make me as the poorest vassal is</line>

            <line>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</line>
            <line>To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,</line>
            <line>Better opinion, better confirmation;</line>
            <line>For all the soil of the achievement goes</line>
            <line>With me into the earth. It seem'd in me</line>
            <line>But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,</line>
            <line>And I had many living to upbraid</line>
            <line>My gain of it by their assistances;</line>
            <line>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</line>
            <line>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears</line>
            <line>Thou see'st with peril I have answered;</line>
            <line>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</line>
            <line>Acting that argument: and now my death</line>
            <line>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,</line>
            <line>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</line>
            <line>So thou the garland wear'st successively.</line>
            <line>Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,</line>
            <line>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</line>
            <line>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</line>
            <line>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;</line>
            <line>By whose fell working I was first advanced</line>
            <line>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</line>
            <line>To be again displaced: which to avoid,</line>
            <line>I cut them off; and had a purpose now</line>
            <line>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</line>
            <line>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</line>
            <line>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</line>
            <line>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</line>
            <line>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</line>
            <line>May waste the memory of the former days.</line>
            <line>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</line>
            <line>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</line>
            <line>How I came by the crown, O God forgive;</line>
            <line>And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</line>

            <line>You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;</line>
            <line>Then plain and right must my possession be:</line>

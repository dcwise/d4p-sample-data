            <line>Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;</line>
            <line>But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,</line>
            <line>And well consider of them; make good speed.</line>

            <line>How many thousand of my poorest subjects</line>
            <line>Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,</line>
            <line>Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,</line>
            <line>That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down</line>
            <line>And steep my senses in forgetfulness?</line>
            <line>Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,</line>
            <line>Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee</line>
            <line>And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,</line>
            <line>Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,</line>
            <line>Under the canopies of costly state,</line>
            <line>And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?</line>
            <line>O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile</line>
            <line>In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch</line>
            <line>A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?</line>
            <line>Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast</line>
            <line>Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains</line>
            <line>In cradle of the rude imperious surge</line>
            <line>And in the visitation of the winds,</line>
            <line>Who take the ruffian billows by the top,</line>
            <line>Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them</line>
            <line>With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,</line>
            <line>That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?</line>
            <line>Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose</line>
            <line>To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,</line>
            <line>And in the calmest and most stillest night,</line>
            <line>With all appliances and means to boot,</line>
            <line>Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!</line>
            <line>Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.</line>

            <line>Is it good morrow, lords?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
            <line>'Tis one o'clock, and past.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
            <line>Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.</line>
            <line>Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>We have, my liege.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
            <line>Then you perceive the body of our kingdom</line>
            <line>How foul it is; what rank diseases grow</line>
            <line>And with what danger, near the heart of it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
            <line>It is but as a body yet distemper'd;</line>
            <line>Which to his former strength may be restored</line>
            <line>With good advice and little medicine:</line>
            <line>My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
            <line>O God! that one might read the book of fate,</line>
            <line>And see the revolution of the times</line>
            <line>Make mountains level, and the continent,</line>
            <line>Weary of solid firmness, melt itself</line>
            <line>Into the sea! and, other times, to see</line>
            <line>The beachy girdle of the ocean</line>
            <line>Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,</line>
            <line>And changes fill the cup of alteration</line>
            <line>With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,</line>
            <line>The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,</line>
            <line>What perils past, what crosses to ensue,</line>
            <line>Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.</line>
            <line>'Tis not 'ten years gone</line>
            <line>Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,</line>
            <line>Did feast together, and in two years after</line>
            <line>Were they at wars: it is but eight years since</line>
            <line>This Percy was the man nearest my soul,</line>
            <line>Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs</line>
            <line>And laid his love and life under my foot,</line>
            <line>Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard</line>
            <line>Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--</line>
            <line>You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--</line>
            <stagedir>To WARWICK</stagedir>
            <line>When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,</line>
            <line>Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,</line>
            <line>Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?</line>
            <line>'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which</line>
            <line>My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'</line>
            <line>Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,</line>
            <line>But that necessity so bow'd the state</line>
            <line>That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:</line>
            <line>'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,</line>
            <line>'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,</line>
            <line>Shall break into corruption:' so went on,</line>
            <line>Foretelling this same time's condition</line>
            <line>And the division of our amity.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
            <line>There is a history in all men's lives,</line>
            <line>Figuring the nature of the times deceased;</line>
            <line>The which observed, a man may prophesy,</line>
            <line>With a near aim, of the main chance of things</line>
            <line>As yet not come to life, which in their seeds</line>
            <line>And weak beginnings lie intreasured.</line>
            <line>Such things become the hatch and brood of time;</line>
            <line>And by the necessary form of this</line>
            <line>King Richard might create a perfect guess</line>
            <line>That great Northumberland, then false to him,</line>
            <line>Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;</line>
            <line>Which should not find a ground to root upon,</line>
            <line>Unless on you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
            <line>Are these things then necessities?</line>
            <line>Then let us meet them like necessities:</line>
            <line>And that same word even now cries out on us:</line>
            <line>They say the bishop and Northumberland</line>
            <line>Are fifty thousand strong.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>WARWICK</speaker>
            <line>It cannot be, my lord;</line>
            <line>Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,</line>
            <line>The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace</line>
            <line>To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,</line>
            <line>The powers that you already have sent forth</line>
            <line>Shall bring this prize in very easily.</line>
            <line>To comfort you the more, I have received</line>
            <line>A certain instance that Glendower is dead.</line>
            <line>Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,</line>
            <line>And these unseason'd hours perforce must add</line>
            <line>Unto your sickness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY IV</speaker>
            <line>I will take your counsel:</line>
            <line>And were these inward wars once out of hand,</line>
            <line>We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.</line>

            <line>I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were</line>

            <line>Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home</line>

            <line>Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are</line>

            <line>Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a</line>
            <line>man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,</line>
            <line>bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the</line>
            <line>spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a</line>
            <line>ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and</line>
            <line>discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's</line>
            <line>hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets</line>
            <line>on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced</line>
            <line>fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no</line>
            <line>mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim</line>
            <line>level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;</line>
            <line>how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run</line>
            <line>off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the</line>
            <line>great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
            <line>Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go</line>
            <line>to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a</line>
            <line>little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'</line>
            <line>faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a</line>
            <line>tester for thee.</line>

            <line>He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it</line>
            <line>right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at</line>
            <line>Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's</line>
            <line>show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'</line>
            <line>would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about</line>
            <line>and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,</line>
            <line>tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and</line>
            <line>away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I</line>
            <line>shall ne'er see such a fellow.</line>

            <line>These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God</line>
            <line>keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words</line>
            <line>with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank</line>
            <line>you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give</line>
            <line>the soldiers coats.</line>

            <line>our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;</line>
            <line>peradventure I will with ye to the court.</line>

            <stagedir>Exeunt Justices</stagedir>
            <line>On, Bardolph; lead the men away.</line>
            <stagedir>Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits, &amp;c</stagedir>
            <line>As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do</line>
            <line>see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how</line>
            <line>subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This</line>
            <line>same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to</line>
            <line>me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he</line>
            <line>hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third</line>
            <line>word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's</line>
            <line>tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a</line>
            <line>man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'</line>
            <line>was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked</line>
            <line>radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it</line>
            <line>with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his</line>
            <line>dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'</line>
            <line>was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a</line>
            <line>monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came</line>
            <line>ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those</line>
            <line>tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the</line>
            <line>carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or</line>
            <line>his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger</line>
            <line>become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a</line>
            <line>Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and</line>
            <line>I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the</line>
            <line>Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding</line>
            <line>among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a</line>
            <line>Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have</line>
            <line>thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the</line>
            <line>case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a</line>
            <line>court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll</line>
            <line>be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall</line>
            <line>go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two</line>
            <line>stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the</line>
            <line>old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I</line>
            <line>may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.</line>

            <line>The king is almost wounded to the death;</line>
            <line>And, in the fortune of my lord your son,</line>
            <line>Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</line>
            <line>Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John</line>
            <line>And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;</line>
            <line>And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,</line>
            <line>Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,</line>
            <line>So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,</line>
            <line>Came not till now to dignify the times,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD BARDOLPH</speaker>
            <line>I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</line>
            <line>A gentleman well bred and of good name,</line>
            <line>That freely render'd me these news for true.</line>

            <line>Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent</line>
            <line>On Tuesday last to listen after news.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD BARDOLPH</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I over-rode him on the way;</line>
            <line>And he is furnish'd with no certainties</line>
            <line>More than he haply may retail from me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TRAVERS</speaker>
            <line>My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back</line>
            <line>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,</line>
            <line>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard</line>
            <line>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</line>
            <line>That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</line>
            <line>He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him</line>
            <line>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</line>
            <line>He told me that rebellion had bad luck</line>
            <line>And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.</line>
            <line>With that, he gave his able horse the head,</line>
            <line>And bending forward struck his armed heels</line>
            <line>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</line>
            <line>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</line>
            <line>He seem'd in running to devour the way,</line>
            <line>Staying no longer question.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>Ha! Again:</line>
            <line>Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?</line>
            <line>Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion</line>
            <line>Had met ill luck?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD BARDOLPH</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I'll tell you what;</line>
            <line>If my young lord your son have not the day,</line>
            <line>Upon mine honour, for a silken point</line>
            <line>I'll give my barony: never talk of it.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</line>
            <line>Give then such instances of loss?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD BARDOLPH</speaker>
            <line>Who, he?</line>
            <line>He was some hilding fellow that had stolen</line>
            <line>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</line>
            <line>Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,</line>
            <line>Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:</line>
            <line>So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood</line>
            <line>Hath left a witness'd usurpation.</line>
            <line>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTON</speaker>
            <line>I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;</line>
            <line>Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</line>
            <line>To fright our party.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>How doth my son and brother?</line>
            <line>Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek</line>
            <line>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</line>
            <line>Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</line>
            <line>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</line>
            <line>Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,</line>
            <line>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</line>
            <line>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</line>
            <line>And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.</line>
            <line>This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;</line>
            <line>Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'</line>
            <line>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:</line>
            <line>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</line>
            <line>Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</line>
            <line>Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTON</speaker>
            <line>Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;</line>
            <line>But, for my lord your son--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>Why, he is dead.</line>
            <line>See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</line>
            <line>He that but fears the thing he would not know</line>
            <line>Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes</line>
            <line>That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;</line>
            <line>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</line>
            <line>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</line>
            <line>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTON</speaker>
            <line>You are too great to be by me gainsaid:</line>
            <line>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.</line>
            <line>I see a strange confession in thine eye:</line>
            <line>Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin</line>
            <line>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</line>
            <line>The tongue offends not that reports his death:</line>
            <line>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</line>
            <line>Not he which says the dead is not alive.</line>
            <line>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</line>
            <line>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</line>
            <line>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</line>
            <line>Remember'd tolling a departing friend.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD BARDOLPH</speaker>
            <line>I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTON</speaker>
            <line>I am sorry I should force you to believe</line>
            <line>That which I would to God I had not seen;</line>
            <line>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</line>
            <line>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,</line>
            <line>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</line>
            <line>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</line>
            <line>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</line>
            <line>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</line>
            <line>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</line>
            <line>Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</line>
            <line>From the best temper'd courage in his troops;</line>
            <line>For from his metal was his party steel'd;</line>
            <line>Which once in him abated, all the rest</line>
            <line>Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:</line>
            <line>And as the thing that's heavy in itself,</line>
            <line>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</line>
            <line>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,</line>
            <line>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</line>
            <line>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</line>
            <line>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</line>
            <line>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester</line>
            <line>Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</line>
            <line>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword</line>
            <line>Had three times slain the appearance of the king,</line>
            <line>'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</line>
            <line>Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,</line>
            <line>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</line>
            <line>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out</line>
            <line>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</line>
            <line>Under the conduct of young Lancaster</line>
            <line>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>NORTHUMBERLAND</speaker>
            <line>For this I shall have time enough to mourn.</line>
            <line>In poison there is physic; and these news,</line>
            <line>Having been well, that would have made me sick,</line>
            <line>Being sick, have in some measure made me well:</line>
            <line>And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,</line>
            <line>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</line>
            <line>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</line>
            <line>Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,</line>
            <line>Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,</line>
            <line>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!</line>
            <line>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</line>
            <line>Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!</line>
            <line>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head</line>
            <line>Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.</line>
            <line>Now bind my brows with iron; and approach</line>
            <line>The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring</line>
            <line>To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!</line>
            <line>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand</line>
            <line>Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!</line>
            <line>And let this world no longer be a stage</line>
            <line>To feed contention in a lingering act;</line>
            <line>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</line>
            <line>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</line>
            <line>On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</line>
            <line>And darkness be the burier of the dead!</line>

            <line>You cast the event of war, my noble lord,</line>
            <line>And summ'd the account of chance, before you said</line>
            <line>'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,</line>
            <line>That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:</line>
            <line>You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,</line>
            <line>More likely to fall in than to get o'er;</line>
            <line>You were advised his flesh was capable</line>

            <line>Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:</line>
            <line>Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,</line>

            <line>He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy</line>

            <line>Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the</line>
            <line>brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not</line>
            <line>able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more</line>
            <line>than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only</line>
            <line>witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other</line>
            <line>men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that</line>
            <line>hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the</line>
            <line>prince put thee into my service for any other reason</line>
            <line>than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.</line>
            <line>Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn</line>
            <line>in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never</line>
            <line>manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you</line>
            <line>neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and</line>
            <line>send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--</line>
            <line>the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is</line>
            <line>not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in</line>
            <line>the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his</line>
            <line>cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is</line>
            <line>a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis</line>
            <line>not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a</line>
            <line>face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence</line>
            <line>out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had</line>
            <line>writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He</line>
            <line>may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,</line>
            <line>I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about</line>
            <line>the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</line>

            <line>He said, sir, you should procure him better</line>
            <line>assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his</line>
            <line>band and yours; he liked not the security.</line>

            <line>Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his</line>
            <line>tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally</line>
            <line>yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,</line>
            <line>and then stand upon security! The whoreson</line>
            <line>smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and</line>
            <line>bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is</line>
            <line>through with them in honest taking up, then they</line>
            <line>must stand upon security. I had as lief they would</line>
            <line>put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with</line>
            <line>security. I looked a' should have sent me two and</line>
            <line>twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he</line>
            <line>sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;</line>
            <line>for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness</line>
            <line>of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he</line>
            <line>see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.</line>

            <line>I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in</line>

            <line>My good lord! God give your lordship good time of</line>
            <line>day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard</line>
            <line>say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship</line>
            <line>goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not</line>
            <line>clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in</line>
            <line>you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must</line>
            <line>humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care</line>
            <line>of your health.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord Chief-Justice</speaker>
            <line>Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is</line>
            <line>returned with some discomfort from Wales.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord Chief-Justice</speaker>
            <line>I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into</line>
            <line>this same whoreson apoplexy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord Chief-Justice</speaker>
            <line>Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with</line>
            <line>you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,</line>
            <line>an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the</line>
            <line>blood, a whoreson tingling.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord Chief-Justice</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>It hath its original from much grief, from study and</line>
            <line>perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of</line>
            <line>his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord Chief-Justice</speaker>
            <line>I think you are fallen into the disease; for you</line>

            <line>Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please</line>
            <line>you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady</line>
            <line>of not marking, that I am troubled withal.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord Chief-Justice</speaker>
            <line>To punish you by the heels would amend the</line>
            <line>attention of your ears; and I care not if I do</line>
            <line>become your physician.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:</line>
            <line>your lordship may minister the potion of</line>
            <line>imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how</line>
            <line>should I be your patient to follow your</line>
            <line>prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a</line>
            <line>scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord Chief-Justice</speaker>
            <line>Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your</line>
            <line>day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded</line>
            <line>over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may</line>

            <speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
            <line>A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say</line>

            <line>Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope</line>
            <line>he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:</line>
            <line>and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I</line>
            <line>cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these</line>
            <line>costermonger times that true valour is turned</line>
            <line>bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath</line>
            <line>his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the</line>
            <line>other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of</line>
            <line>this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.</line>
            <line>You that are old consider not the capacities of us</line>
            <line>that are young; you do measure the heat of our</line>
            <line>livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we</line>

            <line>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the</line>
            <line>afternoon, with a white head and something a round</line>
            <line>belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing</line>
            <line>and singing of anthems. To approve my youth</line>
            <line>further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in</line>
            <line>judgment and understanding; and he that will caper</line>
            <line>with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the</line>
            <line>money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that</line>
            <line>the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,</line>
            <line>and you took it like a sensible lord. I have</line>
            <line>chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;</line>
            <line>marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk</line>

            <line>you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,</line>
            <line>that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the</line>
            <line>Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean</line>
            <line>not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,</line>
            <line>and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I</line>
            <line>might never spit white again. There is not a</line>
            <line>dangerous action can peep out his head but I am</line>
            <line>thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it</line>
            <line>was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if</line>
            <line>they have a good thing, to make it too common. If</line>
            <line>ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give</line>
            <line>me rest. I would to God my name were not so</line>
            <line>terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be</line>

            <line>What do we then but draw anew the model</line>
            <line>In fewer offices, or at last desist</line>
            <line>To build at all? Much more, in this great work,</line>
            <line>Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down</line>

            <line>We fortify in paper and in figures,</line>
            <line>Using the names of men instead of men:</line>
            <line>Like one that draws the model of a house</line>
            <line>Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,</line>

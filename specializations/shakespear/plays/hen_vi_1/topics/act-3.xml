            <speaker>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
            <line>Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,</line>
            <line>With written pamphlets studiously devised,</line>
            <line>Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,</line>
            <line>Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,</line>
            <line>Do it without invention, suddenly;</line>
            <line>As I with sudden and extemporal speech</line>
            <line>Purpose to answer what thou canst object.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,</line>
            <line>Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.</line>
            <line>Think not, although in writing I preferr'd</line>
            <line>The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,</line>
            <line>That therefore I have forged, or am not able</line>
            <line>Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:</line>
            <line>No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,</line>
            <line>Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,</line>
            <line>As very infants prattle of thy pride.</line>
            <line>Thou art a most pernicious usurer,</line>
            <line>Forward by nature, enemy to peace;</line>
            <line>Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems</line>
            <line>A man of thy profession and degree;</line>
            <line>And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?</line>
            <line>In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,</line>
            <line>As well at London bridge as at the Tower.</line>
            <line>Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,</line>
            <line>The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt</line>
            <line>From envious malice of thy swelling heart.</line>

            <speaker>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
            <line>Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe</line>
            <line>To give me hearing what I shall reply.</line>
            <line>If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,</line>
            <line>As he will have me, how am I so poor?</line>
            <line>Or how haps it I seek not to advance</line>
            <line>Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?</line>
            <line>And for dissension, who preferreth peace</line>
            <line>More than I do?--except I be provoked.</line>
            <line>No, my good lords, it is not that offends;</line>
            <line>It is not that that hath incensed the duke:</line>
            <line>It is, because no one should sway but he;</line>
            <line>No one but he should be about the king;</line>
            <line>And that engenders thunder in his breast</line>
            <line>And makes him roar these accusations forth.</line>
            <line>But he shall know I am as good--</line>

            <line>Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,</line>
            <line>But one imperious in another's throne?</line>

            <line>Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell</line>
            <line>Civil dissension is a viperous worm</line>

            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Have you perused the letters from the pope,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
            <line>Well, my good lord; and as the only means</line>
            <line>To stop effusion of our Christian blood</line>
            <line>And 'stablish quietness on every side.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VI</speaker>
            <line>Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought</line>
            <line>It was both impious and unnatural</line>
            <line>That such immanity and bloody strife</line>
            <line>Should reign among professors of one faith.</line>

            <line>The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,</line>
            <line>A man of great authority in France,</line>
            <line>Proffers his only daughter to your grace</line>

            <line>Marriage, uncle! alas, my years are young!</line>
            <line>And fitter is my study and my books</line>
            <line>Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.</line>
            <line>Yet call the ambassador; and, as you please,</line>

            <line>And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?</line>
            <line>Then I perceive that will be verified</line>

            <line>And so, my lord protector, see them guarded</line>

            <line>Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive</line>

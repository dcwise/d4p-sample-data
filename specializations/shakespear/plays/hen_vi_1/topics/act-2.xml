            <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
            <line>Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?</line>
            <line>Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,</line>
            <line>Make us partakers of a little gain,</line>

            <line>Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,</line>
            <line>Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?</line>
            <line>Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,</line>
            <line>This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
            <line>Duke of Alencon, this was your default,</line>
            <line>That, being captain of the watch to-night,</line>
            <line>Did look no better to that weighty charge.</line>

            <line>Within her quarter and mine own precinct</line>
            <line>I was employ'd in passing to and fro,</line>

            <line>And now there rests no other shift but this;</line>
            <line>To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,</line>

            <line>Will I upon thy party wear this rose:</line>
            <line>And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,</line>
            <line>Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,</line>
            <line>Shall send between the red rose and the white</line>

            <line>Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,</line>

            <line>Even like a man new haled from the rack,</line>
            <line>So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.</line>
            <line>And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,</line>
            <line>Nestor-like aged in an age of care,</line>
            <line>Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.</line>
            <line>These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,</line>
            <line>Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;</line>
            <line>Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,</line>
            <line>And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine</line>
            <line>That droops his sapless branches to the ground;</line>
            <line>Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,</line>
            <line>Unable to support this lump of clay,</line>
            <line>Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,</line>
            <line>As witting I no other comfort have.</line>

            <line>Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.</line>
            <line>Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,</line>
            <line>Before whose glory I was great in arms,</line>
            <line>This loathsome sequestration have I had:</line>
            <line>And even since then hath Richard been obscured,</line>
            <line>Deprived of honour and inheritance.</line>
            <line>But now the arbitrator of despairs,</line>
            <line>Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,</line>
            <line>With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:</line>
            <line>I would his troubles likewise were expired,</line>

            <line>Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,</line>
            <line>Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.</line>

            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,</line>
            <line>And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:</line>
            <line>O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,</line>
            <line>That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.</line>
            <line>And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,</line>
            <line>Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</speaker>
            <line>First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;</line>
            <line>And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.</line>
            <line>This day, in argument upon a case,</line>
            <line>Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;</line>
            <line>Among which terms he used his lavish tongue</line>
            <line>And did upbraid me with my father's death:</line>
            <line>Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,</line>
            <line>Else with the like I had requited him.</line>
            <line>Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,</line>
            <line>In honour of a true Plantagenet</line>
            <line>And for alliance sake, declare the cause</line>
            <line>My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me</line>
            <line>And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth</line>
            <line>Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,</line>
            <line>Was cursed instrument of his decease.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</speaker>
            <line>Discover more at large what cause that was,</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>I will, if that my fading breath permit</line>
            <line>And death approach not ere my tale be done.</line>
            <line>Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,</line>
            <line>Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,</line>
            <line>The first-begotten and the lawful heir,</line>
            <line>Of Edward king, the third of that descent:</line>
            <line>During whose reign the Percies of the north,</line>
            <line>Finding his usurpation most unjust,</line>
            <line>Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:</line>
            <line>The reason moved these warlike lords to this</line>
            <line>Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,</line>
            <line>Leaving no heir begotten of his body--</line>
            <line>I was the next by birth and parentage;</line>
            <line>For by my mother I derived am</line>
            <line>From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son</line>
            <line>To King Edward the Third; whereas he</line>
            <line>From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,</line>
            <line>Being but fourth of that heroic line.</line>
            <line>But mark: as in this haughty attempt</line>
            <line>They laboured to plant the rightful heir,</line>
            <line>I lost my liberty and they their lives.</line>
            <line>Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,</line>
            <line>Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,</line>
            <line>Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived</line>
            <line>From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,</line>
            <line>Marrying my sister that thy mother was,</line>
            <line>Again in pity of my hard distress</line>
            <line>Levied an army, weening to redeem</line>
            <line>And have install'd me in the diadem:</line>
            <line>But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl</line>
            <line>And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,</line>
            <line>In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</speaker>
            <line>Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>True; and thou seest that I no issue have</line>
            <line>And that my fainting words do warrant death;</line>
            <line>Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:</line>
            <line>But yet be wary in thy studious care.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>RICHARD PLANTAGENET</speaker>
            <line>Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:</line>
            <line>But yet, methinks, my father's execution</line>
            <line>Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>With silence, nephew, be thou politic:</line>
            <line>Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,</line>
            <line>And like a mountain, not to be removed.</line>
            <line>But now thy uncle is removing hence:</line>
            <line>As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd</line>
            <line>With long continuance in a settled place.</line>

            <line>O, uncle, would some part of my young years</line>
            <line>Might but redeem the passage of your age!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MORTIMER</speaker>
            <line>Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth</line>

            <line>Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;</line>
            <line>Only give order for my funeral:</line>
            <line>And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes</line>
            <line>And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!</line>

            <line>In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage</line>
            <line>And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.</line>
            <line>Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;</line>
            <line>And what I do imagine let that rest.</line>
            <line>Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself</line>

            <line>Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,</line>

            <line>Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:</line>
            <line>I doubt not but with honour to redress;</line>
            <line>And therefore haste I to the parliament,</line>

            <line>England ne'er had a king until his time.</line>
            <line>Virtue he had, deserving to command:</line>
            <line>His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:</line>
            <line>His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;</line>
            <line>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</line>
            <line>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</line>
            <line>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</line>
            <line>What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:</line>

            <line>And death's dishonourable victory</line>
            <line>We with our stately presence glorify,</line>

            <line>What! shall we curse the planets of mishap</line>
            <line>That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?</line>
            <line>Or shall we think the subtle-witted French</line>

            <line>Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day</line>
            <line>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</line>

            <line>Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:</line>
            <line>Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:</line>
            <line>Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.</line>
            <line>Posterity, await for wretched years,</line>

            <line>And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,</line>
            <line>You are disputing of your generals:</line>
            <line>One would have lingering wars with little cost;</line>
            <line>Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</line>
            <line>A third thinks, without expense at all,</line>
            <line>By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.</line>
            <line>Awake, awake, English nobility!</line>
            <line>Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:</line>

            <line>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,</line>
            <line>I must inform you of a dismal fight</line>
            <line>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BISHOP OF WINCHESTER</speaker>
            <line>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Messenger</speaker>
            <line>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:</line>
            <line>The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</line>
            <line>The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</line>
            <line>Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</line>
            <line>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</line>
            <line>By three and twenty thousand of the French</line>
            <line>Was round encompassed and set upon.</line>
            <line>No leisure had he to enrank his men;</line>
            <line>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</line>
            <line>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</line>
            <line>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</line>
            <line>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</line>
            <line>More than three hours the fight continued;</line>
            <line>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</line>
            <line>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</line>
            <line>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</line>
            <line>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</line>
            <line>The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;</line>
            <line>All the whole army stood agazed on him:</line>
            <line>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</line>
            <line>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</line>
            <line>And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</line>
            <line>Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,</line>
            <line>If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:</line>
            <line>He, being in the vaward, placed behind</line>
            <line>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</line>
            <line>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</line>
            <line>Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</line>
            <line>Enclosed were they with their enemies:</line>
            <line>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</line>
            <line>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</line>
            <line>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</line>
            <line>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
            <line>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,</line>
            <line>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</line>
            <line>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</line>
            <line>Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.</line>

            <line>O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,</line>
            <line>And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:</line>
            <line>Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BEDFORD</speaker>
            <line>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</line>
            <line>I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:</line>
            <line>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</line>
            <line>Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.</line>
            <line>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;</line>
            <line>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</line>
            <line>To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:</line>
            <line>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</line>

            <line>Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,</line>
            <line>How shall I honour thee for this success?</line>
            <line>Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens</line>
            <line>That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.</line>
            <line>France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!</line>
            <line>Recover'd is the town of Orleans:</line>
            <line>More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state.</line>

            <line>Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?</line>
            <line>Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires</line>
            <line>And feast and banquet in the open streets,</line>
            <line>To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.</line>

            <line>'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;</line>
            <line>For which I will divide my crown with her,</line>
            <line>And all the priests and friars in my realm</line>
            <line>Shall in procession sing her endless praise.</line>
            <line>A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear</line>
            <line>Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was:</line>
            <line>In memory of her when she is dead,</line>
            <line>Her ashes, in an urn more precious</line>
            <line>Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius,</line>
            <line>Transported shall be at high festivals</line>
            <line>Before the kings and queens of France.</line>
            <line>No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,</line>
            <line>But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.</line>
            <line>Come in, and let us banquet royally,</line>
            <line>After this golden day of victory.</line>

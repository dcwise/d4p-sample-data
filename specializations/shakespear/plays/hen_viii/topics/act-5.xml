            <line>It hath struck.</line>

            <speaker>GARDINER</speaker>
            <line>These should be hours for necessities,</line>
            <line>Not for delights; times to repair our nature</line>
            <line>With comforting repose, and not for us</line>
            <line>To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!</line>
            <line>Whither so late?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>Came you from the king, my lord</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GARDINER</speaker>
            <line>I did, Sir Thomas: and left him at primero</line>
            <line>With the Duke of Suffolk.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>I must to him too,</line>
            <line>Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GARDINER</speaker>
            <line>Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?</line>
            <line>It seems you are in haste: an if there be</line>
            <line>No great offence belongs to't, give your friend</line>
            <line>Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,</line>
            <line>As they say spirits do, at midnight, have</line>
            <line>In them a wilder nature than the business</line>
            <line>That seeks dispatch by day.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I love you;</line>
            <line>And durst commend a secret to your ear</line>
            <line>Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,</line>
            <line>They say, in great extremity; and fear'd</line>
            <line>She'll with the labour end.</line>

            <speaker>GARDINER</speaker>
            <line>The fruit she goes with</line>
            <line>I pray for heartily, that it may find</line>
            <line>Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,</line>
            <line>I wish it grubb'd up now.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>Methinks I could</line>
            <line>Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says</line>
            <line>She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does</line>
            <line>Deserve our better wishes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GARDINER</speaker>
            <line>But, sir, sir,</line>
            <line>Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman</line>
            <line>Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;</line>
            <line>And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,</line>
            <line>'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,</line>
            <line>Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,</line>
            <line>Sleep in their graves.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>Now, sir, you speak of two</line>
            <line>The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,</line>
            <line>Beside that of the jewel house, is made master</line>
            <line>O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,</line>
            <line>Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,</line>
            <line>With which the time will load him. The archbishop</line>
            <line>Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak</line>
            <line>One syllable against him?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GARDINER</speaker>
            <line>Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,</line>
            <line>There are that dare; and I myself have ventured</line>
            <line>To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,</line>
            <line>Sir, I may tell it you, I think I have</line>
            <line>Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is,</line>
            <line>For so I know he is, they know he is,</line>
            <line>A most arch heretic, a pestilence</line>
            <line>That does infect the land: with which they moved</line>
            <line>Have broken with the king; who hath so far</line>
            <line>Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace</line>
            <line>And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs</line>
            <line>Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded</line>
            <line>To-morrow morning to the council-board</line>
            <line>He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,</line>
            <line>And we must root him out. From your affairs</line>
            <line>I hinder you too long: good night, Sir Thomas.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.</line>

            <speaker>KING HENRY VIII</speaker>
            <line>Charles, I will play no more tonight;</line>
            <line>My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>Sir, I did never win of you before.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VIII</speaker>
            <line>But little, Charles;</line>
            <line>Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.</line>
            <line>Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>I could not personally deliver to her</line>
            <line>What you commanded me, but by her woman</line>
            <line>I sent your message; who return'd her thanks</line>
            <line>In the great'st humbleness, and desired your highness</line>
            <line>Most heartily to pray for her.</line>

            <speaker>KING HENRY VIII</speaker>
            <line>What say'st thou, ha?</line>
            <line>To pray for her? what, is she crying out?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>So said her woman; and that her sufferance made</line>
            <line>Almost each pang a death.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VIII</speaker>
            <line>Alas, good lady!</line>

            <line>With gentle travail, to the gladding of</line>
            <line>Your highness with an heir!</line>

            <line>'Tis midnight, Charles;</line>
            <line>Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember</line>
            <line>The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;</line>
            <line>For I must think of that which company</line>
            <line>Would not be friendly to.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>I wish your highness</line>

            <line>You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,</line>

            <line>You are potently opposed; and with a malice</line>

            <line>When she has so much English.</line>

            <line>Let me speak, sir,</line>
            <line>For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter</line>
            <line>Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.</line>
            <line>This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--</line>
            <line>Though in her cradle, yet now promises</line>
            <line>Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</line>
            <line>Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--</line>
            <line>But few now living can behold that goodness--</line>
            <line>A pattern to all princes living with her,</line>
            <line>And all that shall succeed: Saba was never</line>
            <line>More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue</line>
            <line>Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,</line>
            <line>That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,</line>
            <line>With all the virtues that attend the good,</line>
            <line>Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,</line>
            <line>Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:</line>
            <line>She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;</line>
            <line>Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,</line>
            <line>And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:</line>
            <line>In her days every man shall eat in safety,</line>
            <line>Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing</line>
            <line>The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:</line>
            <line>God shall be truly known; and those about her</line>
            <line>From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,</line>
            <line>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</line>
            <line>Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when</line>
            <line>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</line>
            <line>Her ashes new create another heir,</line>
            <line>As great in admiration as herself;</line>
            <line>So shall she leave her blessedness to one,</line>
            <line>When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,</line>
            <line>Who from the sacred ashes of her honour</line>
            <line>Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,</line>
            <line>And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</line>
            <line>That were the servants to this chosen infant,</line>
            <line>Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:</line>
            <line>Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</line>
            <line>His honour and the greatness of his name</line>
            <line>Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,</line>
            <line>And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches</line>
            <line>To all the plains about him: our children's children</line>
            <line>Shall see this, and bless heaven.</line>

            <line>Would I had known no more! but she must die,</line>
            <line>She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,</line>
            <line>A most unspotted lily shall she pass</line>

            <line>Thou hast made me now a man! never, before</line>
            <line>This happy child, did I get any thing:</line>
            <line>This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,</line>
            <line>That when I am in heaven I shall desire</line>
            <line>To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.</line>
            <line>I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,</line>
            <line>And your good brethren, I am much beholding;</line>
            <line>I have received much honour by your presence,</line>
            <line>And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:</line>
            <line>Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,</line>
            <line>She will be sick else. This day, no man think</line>
            <line>Has business at his house; for all shall stay:</line>
            <line>This little one shall make it holiday.</line>

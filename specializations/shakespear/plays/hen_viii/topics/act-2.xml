            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Whither away so fast?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>O, God save ye!</line>
            <line>Even to the hall, to hear what shall become</line>
            <line>Of the great Duke of Buckingham.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I'll save you</line>
            <line>That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony</line>
            <line>Of bringing back the prisoner.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Were you there?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Yes, indeed, was I.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Pray, speak what has happen'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>You may guess quickly what.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Is he found guilty?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I am sorry for't.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>So are a number more.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>But, pray, how pass'd it?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I'll tell you in a little. The great duke</line>
            <line>Came to the bar; where to his accusations</line>
            <line>He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</line>
            <line>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</line>
            <line>The king's attorney on the contrary</line>
            <line>Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</line>
            <line>Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired</line>
            <line>To have brought viva voce to his face:</line>
            <line>At which appear'd against him his surveyor;</line>
            <line>Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,</line>
            <line>Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,</line>
            <line>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>That was he</line>
            <line>That fed him with his prophecies?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>The same.</line>
            <line>All these accused him strongly; which he fain</line>
            <line>Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:</line>
            <line>And so his peers, upon this evidence,</line>
            <line>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</line>
            <line>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</line>
            <line>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>After all this, how did he bear himself?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>When he was brought again to the bar, to hear</line>
            <line>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd</line>
            <line>With such an agony, he sweat extremely,</line>
            <line>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:</line>
            <line>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</line>
            <line>In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I do not think he fears death.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Sure, he does not:</line>
            <line>He never was so womanish; the cause</line>
            <line>He may a little grieve at.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Certainly</line>
            <line>The cardinal is the end of this.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>'Tis likely,</line>
            <line>By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,</line>
            <line>Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,</line>
            <line>Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</line>
            <line>Lest he should help his father.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>That trick of state</line>
            <line>Was a deep envious one.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>At his return</line>
            <line>No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</line>
            <line>And generally, whoever the king favours,</line>
            <line>The cardinal instantly will find employment,</line>
            <line>And far enough from court too.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>All the commons</line>
            <line>Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,</line>
            <line>Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much</line>
            <line>They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,</line>
            <line>The mirror of all courtesy;--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Stay there, sir,</line>
            <line>And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves
before him; the axe with the edge towards him;
halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL,
VAUX, SANDS, and common people</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Let's stand close, and behold him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>All good people,</line>
            <line>You that thus far have come to pity me,</line>
            <line>Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.</line>
            <line>I have this day received a traitor's judgment,</line>
            <line>And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,</line>
            <line>And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,</line>
            <line>Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!</line>
            <line>The law I bear no malice for my death;</line>
            <line>'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:</line>
            <line>But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:</line>
            <line>Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:</line>
            <line>Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,</line>
            <line>Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;</line>
            <line>For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.</line>
            <line>For further life in this world I ne'er hope,</line>
            <line>Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies</line>
            <line>More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,</line>
            <line>And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</line>
            <line>His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</line>
            <line>Is only bitter to him, only dying,</line>
            <line>Go with me, like good angels, to my end;</line>
            <line>And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,</line>
            <line>Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,</line>
            <line>And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>I do beseech your grace, for charity,</line>
            <line>If ever any malice in your heart</line>
            <line>Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you</line>
            <line>As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;</line>
            <line>There cannot be those numberless offences</line>
            <line>'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:</line>
            <line>no black envy</line>
            <line>Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;</line>
            <line>And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him</line>
            <line>You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers</line>
            <line>Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,</line>
            <line>Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live</line>
            <line>Longer than I have time to tell his years!</line>
            <line>Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!</line>
            <line>And when old time shall lead him to his end,</line>
            <line>Goodness and he fill up one monument!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LOVELL</speaker>
            <line>To the water side I must conduct your grace;</line>
            <line>Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,</line>
            <line>Who undertakes you to your end.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VAUX</speaker>
            <line>Prepare there,</line>
            <line>The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;</line>
            <line>And fit it with such furniture as suits</line>
            <line>The greatness of his person.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
            <line>Nay, Sir Nicholas,</line>
            <line>Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.</line>
            <line>When I came hither, I was lord high constable</line>
            <line>And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:</line>
            <line>Yet I am richer than my base accusers,</line>
            <line>That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;</line>
            <line>And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.</line>
            <line>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</line>
            <line>Who first raised head against usurping Richard,</line>
            <line>Flying for succor to his servant Banister,</line>
            <line>Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,</line>
            <line>And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!</line>
            <line>Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying</line>
            <line>My father's loss, like a most royal prince,</line>
            <line>Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,</line>
            <line>Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</line>
            <line>Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all</line>
            <line>That made me happy at one stroke has taken</line>
            <line>For ever from the world. I had my trial,</line>
            <line>And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,</line>
            <line>A little happier than my wretched father:</line>
            <line>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</line>
            <line>Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;</line>
            <line>A most unnatural and faithless service!</line>
            <line>Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,</line>
            <line>This from a dying man receive as certain:</line>
            <line>Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels</line>
            <line>Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends</line>
            <line>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</line>
            <line>The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</line>
            <line>Like water from ye, never found again</line>
            <line>But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</line>
            <line>Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour</line>
            <line>Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:</line>
            <line>And when you would say something that is sad,</line>
            <line>Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,</line>
            <line>I fear, too many curses on their beads</line>
            <line>That were the authors.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>If the duke be guiltless,</line>
            <line>'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling</line>
            <line>Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,</line>
            <line>Greater than this.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Good angels keep it from us!</line>
            <line>What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>This secret is so weighty, 'twill require</line>
            <line>A strong faith to conceal it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Let me have it;</line>
            <line>I do not talk much.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I am confident,</line>
            <line>You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear</line>
            <line>A buzzing of a separation</line>
            <line>Between the king and Katharine?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Yes, but it held not:</line>
            <line>For when the king once heard it, out of anger</line>
            <line>He sent command to the lord mayor straight</line>
            <line>To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues</line>
            <line>That durst disperse it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>But that slander, sir,</line>
            <line>Is found a truth now: for it grows again</line>
            <line>Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain</line>
            <line>The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,</line>
            <line>Or some about him near, have, out of malice</line>
            <line>To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple</line>
            <line>That will undo her: to confirm this too,</line>
            <line>Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;</line>
            <line>As all think, for this business.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>'Tis the cardinal;</line>
            <line>And merely to revenge him on the emperor</line>
            <line>For not bestowing on him, at his asking,</line>
            <line>The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel</line>
            <line>That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal</line>
            <line>Will have his will, and she must fall.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>'Tis woful.</line>

            <line>furnished. They were young and handsome, and of the</line>

            <speaker>Chamberlain</speaker>
            <line>It seems the marriage with his brother's wife</line>
            <line>Has crept too near his conscience.</line>

            <speaker>SUFFOLK</speaker>
            <line>No, his conscience</line>

            <speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
            <line>'Tis so:</line>
            <line>This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:</line>
            <line>That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,</line>
            <line>Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.</line>

            <speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
            <line>How holily he works in all his business!</line>
            <line>And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league</line>
            <line>Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,</line>
            <line>He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters</line>
            <line>Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,</line>
            <line>Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:</line>
            <line>And out of all these to restore the king,</line>
            <line>He counsels a divorce; a loss of her</line>
            <line>That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years</line>
            <line>About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;</line>
            <line>Of her that loves him with that excellence</line>
            <line>That angels love good men with; even of her</line>
            <line>That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,</line>
            <line>Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Chamberlain</speaker>
            <line>Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true</line>
            <line>These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,</line>
            <line>And every true heart weeps for't: all that dare</line>
            <line>Look into these affairs see this main end,</line>
            <line>The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open</line>
            <line>The king's eyes, that so long have slept upon</line>

            <line>We had need pray,</line>

            <line>Or this imperious man will work us all</line>
            <line>From princes into pages: all men's honours</line>
            <line>Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd</line>

            <line>For me, my lords,</line>
            <line>I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:</line>
            <line>As I am made without him, so I'll stand,</line>
            <line>If the king please; his curses and his blessings</line>
            <line>Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.</line>
            <line>I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him</line>
            <line>To him that made him proud, the pope.</line>

            <line>From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:</line>
            <line>My lord, you'll bear us company?</line>

            <speaker>Chamberlain</speaker>
            <line>Excuse me;</line>
            <line>The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,</line>
            <line>You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:</line>
            <line>Health to your lordships.</line>

            <line>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;</line>
            <line>And to bestow your pity on me: for</line>
            <line>I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,</line>
            <line>Born out of your dominions; having here</line>
            <line>No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance</line>
            <line>Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,</line>
            <line>In what have I offended you? what cause</line>
            <line>Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,</line>
            <line>That thus you should proceed to put me off,</line>
            <line>And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,</line>

            <line>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends</line>
            <line>Have I not strove to love, although I knew</line>

            <line>That I have been your wife, in this obedience,</line>
            <line>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest</line>
            <line>With many children by you: if, in the course</line>

            <line>Or how far further shall, is warranted</line>
            <line>By a commission from the consistory,</line>
            <line>Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me</line>
            <line>That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:</line>
            <line>The king is present: if it be known to him</line>
            <line>That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,</line>
            <line>And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much</line>
            <line>As you have done my truth. If he know</line>
            <line>That I am free of your report, he knows</line>
            <line>I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him</line>
            <line>It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to</line>
            <line>Remove these thoughts from you: the which before</line>
            <line>His highness shall speak in, I do beseech</line>
            <line>You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking</line>
            <line>And to say so no more.</line>

            <line>My lord, my lord,</line>
            <line>I am a simple woman, much too weak</line>
            <line>To oppose your cunning. You're meek and</line>
            <line>humble-mouth'd;</line>
            <line>You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,</line>
            <line>With meekness and humility; but your heart</line>
            <line>Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.</line>
            <line>You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,</line>
            <line>Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted</line>
            <line>Where powers are your retainers, and your words,</line>
            <line>Domestics to you, serve your will as't please</line>
            <line>Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,</line>
            <line>You tender more your person's honour than</line>
            <line>Your high profession spiritual: that again</line>
            <line>I do refuse you for my judge; and here,</line>
            <line>Before you all, appeal unto the pope,</line>
            <line>To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,</line>
            <line>And to be judged by him.</line>

            <line>That it shall please you to declare, in hearing</line>
            <line>Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,</line>
            <line>There must I be unloosed, although not there</line>
            <line>At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I</line>
            <line>Did broach this business to your highness; or</line>
            <line>Laid any scruple in your way, which might</line>
            <line>Induce you to the question on't? or ever</line>
            <line>Have to you, but with thanks to God for such</line>
            <line>A royal lady, spake one the least word that might</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VIII</speaker>
            <line>My lord cardinal,</line>
            <line>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,</line>
            <line>I free you from't. You are not to be taught</line>
            <line>That you have many enemies, that know not</line>
            <line>Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,</line>
            <line>Bark when their fellows do: by some of these</line>
            <line>The queen is put in anger. You're excused:</line>
            <line>But will you be more justified? You ever</line>
            <line>Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired</line>
            <line>It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,</line>
            <line>The passages made toward it: on my honour,</line>
            <line>I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,</line>
            <line>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,</line>
            <line>I will be bold with time and your attention:</line>
            <line>Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:</line>
            <line>My conscience first received a tenderness,</line>
            <line>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</line>
            <line>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</line>
            <line>Who had been hither sent on the debating</line>
            <line>A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</line>
            <line>Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,</line>
            <line>Ere a determinate resolution, he,</line>
            <line>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</line>
            <line>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</line>
            <line>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</line>
            <line>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</line>
            <line>Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook</line>
            <line>The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</line>
            <line>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</line>
            <line>The region of my breast; which forced such way,</line>
            <line>That many mazed considerings did throng</line>
            <line>And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</line>
            <line>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</line>
            <line>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</line>
            <line>If it conceived a male child by me, should</line>
            <line>Do no more offices of life to't than</line>
            <line>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</line>
            <line>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</line>
            <line>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</line>
            <line>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</line>
            <line>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</line>
            <line>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</line>
            <line>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</line>
            <line>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</line>
            <line>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</line>
            <line>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</line>
            <line>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</line>
            <line>Now present here together: that's to say,</line>
            <line>I meant to rectify my conscience,--which</line>
            <line>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--</line>
            <line>By all the reverend fathers of the land</line>
            <line>And doctors learn'd: first I began in private</line>
            <line>With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember</line>
            <line>How under my oppression I did reek,</line>
            <line>When I first moved you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LINCOLN</speaker>
            <line>Very well, my liege.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VIII</speaker>
            <line>I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say</line>
            <line>How far you satisfied me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LINCOLN</speaker>
            <line>So please your highness,</line>
            <line>The question did at first so stagger me,</line>
            <line>Bearing a state of mighty moment in't</line>
            <line>And consequence of dread, that I committed</line>
            <line>The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;</line>
            <line>And did entreat your highness to this course</line>
            <line>Which you are running here.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING HENRY VIII</speaker>
            <line>I then moved you,</line>
            <line>My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave</line>
            <line>To make this present summons: unsolicited</line>
            <line>I left no reverend person in this court;</line>
            <line>But by particular consent proceeded</line>
            <line>Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:</line>
            <line>For no dislike i' the world against the person</line>
            <line>Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points</line>
            <line>Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:</line>
            <line>Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life</line>
            <line>And kingly dignity, we are contented</line>
            <line>To wear our mortal state to come with her,</line>
            <line>Katharine our queen, before the primest creature</line>
            <line>That's paragon'd o' the world.</line>

            <line>So please your highness,</line>
            <line>The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness</line>
            <line>That we adjourn this court till further day:</line>
            <line>Meanwhile must be an earnest motion</line>
            <line>Made to the queen, to call back her appeal</line>
            <line>She intends unto his holiness.</line>

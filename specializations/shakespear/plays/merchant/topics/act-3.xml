         <speech>
            <speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
            <line>Now, what news on the Rialto?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
            <line>Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath</line>
            <line>a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;</line>
            <line>the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very</line>
            <line>dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many</line>
            <line>a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip</line>
            <line>Report be an honest woman of her word.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
            <line>I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever</line>
            <line>knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she</line>
            <line>wept for the death of a third husband. But it is</line>
            <line>true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the</line>
            <line>plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the</line>
            <line>honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough</line>
            <line>to keep his name company!--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
            <line>Come, the full stop.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
            <line>Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath</line>
            <line>lost a ship.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
            <line>I would it might prove the end of his losses.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
            <line>Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my</line>
            <line>prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter SHYLOCK</stagedir>
            <line>How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my</line>
            <line>daughter's flight.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
            <line>That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor</line>
            <line>that made the wings she flew withal.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
            <line>And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was</line>
            <line>fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all</line>
            <line>to leave the dam.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>She is damned for it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
            <line>That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>My own flesh and blood to rebel!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
            <line>Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
            <line>There is more difference between thy flesh and hers</line>
            <line>than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods</line>
            <line>than there is between red wine and rhenish. But</line>
            <line>tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any</line>
            <line>loss at sea or no?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a</line>
            <line>prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the</line>
            <line>Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon</line>
            <line>the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to</line>
            <line>call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was</line>
            <line>wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him</line>
            <line>look to his bond.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
            <line>Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take</line>
            <line>his flesh: what's that good for?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,</line>
            <line>it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and</line>
            <line>hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,</line>
            <line>mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my</line>
            <line>bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine</line>
            <line>enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath</line>
            <line>not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,</line>
            <line>dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with</line>
            <line>the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject</line>
            <line>to the same diseases, healed by the same means,</line>
            <line>warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as</line>
            <line>a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?</line>
            <line>if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison</line>
            <line>us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not</line>
            <line>revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will</line>
            <line>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,</line>
            <line>what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian</line>
            <line>wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by</line>
            <line>Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you</line>
            <line>teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I</line>
            <line>will better the instruction.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter a Servant</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Servant</speaker>
            <line>Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and</line>
            <line>desires to speak with you both.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
            <line>We have been up and down to seek him.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter TUBAL</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
            <line>Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be</line>
            <line>matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou</line>
            <line>found my daughter?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
            <line>I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,</line>
            <line>cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse</line>
            <line>never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it</line>
            <line>till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other</line>
            <line>precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter</line>
            <line>were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!</line>
            <line>would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in</line>
            <line>her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know</line>
            <line>not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon</line>
            <line>loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to</line>
            <line>find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:</line>
            <line>nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my</line>
            <line>shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears</line>
            <line>but of my shedding.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
            <line>Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I</line>
            <line>heard in Genoa,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
            <line>Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
            <line>I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!</line>
            <line>ha, ha! where? in Genoa?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
            <line>Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one</line>
            <line>night fourscore ducats.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my</line>
            <line>gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!</line>
            <line>fourscore ducats!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
            <line>There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my</line>
            <line>company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture</line>
            <line>him: I am glad of it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
            <line>One of them showed me a ring that he had of your</line>
            <line>daughter for a monkey.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my</line>
            <line>turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:</line>
            <line>I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
            <line>But Antonio is certainly undone.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
            <line>Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee</line>
            <line>me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I</line>
            <line>will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were</line>
            <line>he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I</line>
            <line>will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;</line>
            <line>go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
            <line>I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two</line>
            <line>Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,</line>
            <line>I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.</line>
            <line>There's something tells me, but it is not love,</line>
            <line>I would not lose you; and you know yourself,</line>
            <line>Hate counsels not in such a quality.</line>
            <line>But lest you should not understand me well,--</line>
            <line>And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--</line>
            <line>I would detain you here some month or two</line>
            <line>Before you venture for me. I could teach you</line>

            <line>So will I never be: so may you miss me;</line>
            <line>But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,</line>

            <line>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,</line>
            <line>And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,</line>
            <line>With no less presence, but with much more love,</line>
            <line>Than young Alcides, when he did redeem</line>
            <line>The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy</line>
            <line>To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice</line>
            <line>The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,</line>
            <line>With bleared visages, come forth to view</line>

            <line>So may the outward shows be least themselves:</line>
            <line>The world is still deceived with ornament.</line>
            <line>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,</line>
            <line>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,</line>
            <line>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</line>
            <line>What damned error, but some sober brow</line>
            <line>Will bless it and approve it with a text,</line>
            <line>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</line>
            <line>There is no vice so simple but assumes</line>
            <line>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:</line>
            <line>How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</line>
            <line>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</line>
            <line>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;</line>
            <line>Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;</line>
            <line>And these assume but valour's excrement</line>
            <line>To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,</line>
            <line>And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;</line>
            <line>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</line>
            <line>Making them lightest that wear most of it:</line>
            <line>So are those crisped snaky golden locks</line>
            <line>Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,</line>
            <line>Upon supposed fairness, often known</line>
            <line>To be the dowry of a second head,</line>
            <line>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.</line>
            <line>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</line>
            <line>To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</line>
            <line>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,</line>
            <line>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</line>
            <line>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,</line>
            <line>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;</line>
            <line>Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</line>
            <line>'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,</line>
            <line>Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,</line>
            <line>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;</line>
            <line>And here choose I; joy be the consequence!</line>

            <line>Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words</line>
            <line>That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</line>
            <line>When I did first impart my love to you,</line>
            <line>I freely told you, all the wealth I had</line>
            <line>Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;</line>
            <line>And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,</line>
            <line>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</line>
            <line>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</line>
            <line>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</line>
            <line>That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,</line>
            <line>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</line>
            <line>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,</line>
            <line>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;</line>
            <line>The paper as the body of my friend,</line>
            <line>And every word in it a gaping wound,</line>
            <line>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</line>
            <line>Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?</line>
            <line>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</line>
            <line>From Lisbon, Barbary and India?</line>
            <line>And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch</line>

            <line>Not one, my lord.</line>

            <line>The present money to discharge the Jew,</line>
            <line>He would not take it. Never did I know</line>
            <line>A creature, that did bear the shape of man,</line>
            <line>So keen and greedy to confound a man:</line>
            <line>He plies the duke at morning and at night,</line>
            <line>And doth impeach the freedom of the state,</line>
            <line>If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,</line>
            <line>The duke himself, and the magnificoes</line>
            <line>Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;</line>
            <line>But none can drive him from the envious plea</line>

            <line>How every fool can play upon the word! I think the</line>
            <line>best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,</line>
            <line>and discourse grow commendable in none only but</line>
            <line>parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.</line>

            <line>Will you cover then, sir?</line>

            <line>Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show</line>

            <line>tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:</line>
            <line>go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve</line>
            <line>in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.</line>

         <speech>

            <line>For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the</line>
            <line>meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in</line>
            <line>to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and</line>
            <line>conceits shall govern.</line>

            <line>O dear discretion, how his words are suited!</line>
            <line>The fool hath planted in his memory</line>
            <line>An army of good words; and I do know</line>
            <line>A many fools, that stand in better place,</line>
            <line>Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word</line>

            <line>He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;</line>
            <line>And if on earth he do not mean it, then</line>
            <line>In reason he should never come to heaven</line>
            <line>Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match</line>

            <line>And Portia one, there must be something else</line>

            <line>The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,</line>
            <line>To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.</line>
            <line>Bring me the fairest creature northward born,</line>
            <line>Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,</line>

            <line>In terms of choice I am not solely led</line>

            <line>Besides, the lottery of my destiny</line>
            <line>Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:</line>

            <line>His wife who wins me by that means I told you,</line>

            <line>Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,</line>
            <line>Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,</line>
            <line>To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!</line>

         <stagedir>Enter LAUNCELOT</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
            <line>Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from</line>
            <line>this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and</line>
            <line>tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good</line>
            <line>Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot</line>
            <line>Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My</line>
            <line>conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;</line>
            <line>take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest</line>
            <line>Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy</line>
            <line>heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me</line>
            <line>pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the</line>
            <line>fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'</line>
            <line>says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,</line>
            <line>hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely</line>
            <line>to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest</line>
            <line>man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,</line>
            <line>indeed, my father did something smack, something</line>
            <line>grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience</line>
            <line>says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the</line>
            <line>fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.</line>
            <line>'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'</line>
            <line>say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my</line>
            <line>conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,</line>
            <line>who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to</line>
            <line>run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the</line>
            <line>fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil</line>
            <line>himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil</line>
            <line>incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is</line>
            <line>but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel</line>
            <line>me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more</line>
            <line>friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are</line>
            <line>at your command; I will run.</line>

            <line>Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of</line>
            <line>the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his</line>

            <line>your son: give me your blessing: truth will come</line>
            <line>to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
            <line>Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou</line>

            <line>Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou</line>

            <line>It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows</line>

            <line>his service; you may tell every finger I have with</line>

            <line>your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,</line>
            <line>gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I</line>
            <line>will run as far as God has any ground. O rare</line>
            <line>fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I</line>

            <line>A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.</line>
            <line>I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:</line>
            <line>Bassanio told him he would make some speed</line>
            <line>Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;</line>
            <line>Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio</line>
            <line>But stay the very riping of the time;</line>
            <line>And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,</line>
            <line>Let it not enter in your mind of love:</line>
            <line>Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts</line>
            <line>To courtship and such fair ostents of love</line>
            <line>As shall conveniently become you there:'</line>
            <line>And even there, his eye being big with tears,</line>
            <line>Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,</line>
            <line>And with affection wondrous sensible</line>
            <line>He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.</line>

            <line>Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:</line>

            <line>Of the right casket, never in my life</line>

            <line>What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant</line>
            <line>By the fool multitude, that choose by show,</line>
            <line>Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;</line>
            <line>Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,</line>
            <line>Builds in the weather on the outward wall,</line>
            <line>Even in the force and road of casualty.</line>
            <line>I will not choose what many men desire,</line>

            <line>Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;</line>
            <line>Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:</line>
            <line>'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'</line>

            <line>O, that estates, degrees and offices</line>
            <line>Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour</line>

            <line>How many be commanded that command!</line>
            <line>How much low peasantry would then be glean'd</line>
            <line>From the true seed of honour! and how much honour</line>
            <line>Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times</line>
            <line>To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:</line>
            <line>'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'</line>
            <line>I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,</line>

            <line>Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,</line>
            <line>Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart</line>

            <speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
            <line>Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,</line>
            <line>As seal to this indenture of my love,</line>
            <line>That to my home I will no more return,</line>
            <line>Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,</line>
            <line>Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,</line>

            <line>Even till that utmost corner of the west</line>
            <line>Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,</line>
            <line>Will I not think of home, but follow arms.</line>

            <line>O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,</line>

            <speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
            <line>Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent</line>
            <line>Against the brows of this resisting town.</line>
            <line>Call for our chiefest men of discipline,</line>
            <line>To cull the plots of best advantages:</line>
            <line>We'll lay before this town our royal bones,</line>
            <line>Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,</line>
            <line>But we will make it subject to this boy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>Stay for an answer to your embassy,</line>
            <line>Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:</line>
            <line>My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,</line>
            <line>That right in peace which here we urge in war,</line>
            <line>And then we shall repent each drop of blood</line>
            <line>That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.</line>

         <stagedir>Enter CHATILLON</stagedir>

            <speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
            <line>A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,</line>
            <line>Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!</line>
            <line>What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;</line>
            <line>We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CHATILLON</speaker>
            <line>Then turn your forces from this paltry siege</line>
            <line>And stir them up against a mightier task.</line>
            <line>England, impatient of your just demands,</line>
            <line>Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,</line>
            <line>Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time</line>
            <line>To land his legions all as soon as I;</line>
            <line>His marches are expedient to this town,</line>
            <line>His forces strong, his soldiers confident.</line>
            <line>With him along is come the mother-queen,</line>
            <line>An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;</line>
            <line>With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;</line>
            <line>With them a bastard of the king's deceased,</line>
            <line>And all the unsettled humours of the land,</line>
            <line>Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,</line>
            <line>With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,</line>
            <line>Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,</line>
            <line>Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,</line>
            <line>To make hazard of new fortunes here:</line>
            <line>In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits</line>
            <line>Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er</line>
            <line>Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,</line>
            <line>To do offence and scath in Christendom.</line>
            <stagedir>Drum beats</stagedir>
            <line>The interruption of their churlish drums</line>
            <line>Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,</line>
            <line>To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.</line>

            <line>If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,</line>
            <line>Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct</line>

            <line>England we love; and for that England's sake</line>
            <line>With burden of our armour here we sweat.</line>
            <line>This toil of ours should be a work of thine;</line>
            <line>But thou from loving England art so far,</line>

            <line>Cut off the sequence of posterity,</line>
            <line>Out-faced infant state and done a rape</line>
            <line>Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.</line>
            <line>Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;</line>
            <line>These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:</line>

            <line>How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,</line>
            <line>When living blood doth in these temples beat,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
            <line>For our advantage; therefore hear us first.</line>
            <line>These flags of France, that are advanced here</line>
            <line>Before the eye and prospect of your town,</line>
            <line>Have hither march'd to your endamagement:</line>
            <line>The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,</line>
            <line>And ready mounted are they to spit forth</line>
            <line>Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:</line>
            <line>All preparation for a bloody siege</line>
            <line>All merciless proceeding by these French</line>
            <line>Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;</line>
            <line>And but for our approach those sleeping stones,</line>
            <line>That as a waist doth girdle you about,</line>
            <line>By the compulsion of their ordinance</line>
            <line>By this time from their fixed beds of lime</line>
            <line>Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made</line>
            <line>For bloody power to rush upon your peace.</line>
            <line>But on the sight of us your lawful king,</line>
            <line>Who painfully with much expedient march</line>
            <line>Have brought a countercheque before your gates,</line>
            <line>To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,</line>
            <line>Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;</line>
            <line>And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,</line>
            <line>To make a shaking fever in your walls,</line>
            <line>They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,</line>
            <line>To make a faithless error in your ears:</line>
            <line>Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,</line>
            <line>And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,</line>
            <line>Forwearied in this action of swift speed,</line>
            <line>Crave harbourage within your city walls.</line>

            <line>When I have said, make answer to us both.</line>
            <line>Lo, in this right hand, whose protection</line>
            <line>Is most divinely vow'd upon the right</line>
            <line>Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,</line>
            <line>Son to the elder brother of this man,</line>
            <line>And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:</line>
            <line>For this down-trodden equity, we tread</line>
            <line>In warlike march these greens before your town,</line>
            <line>Being no further enemy to you</line>
            <line>Than the constraint of hospitable zeal</line>
            <line>In the relief of this oppressed child</line>
            <line>Religiously provokes. Be pleased then</line>
            <line>To pay that duty which you truly owe</line>
            <line>To that owes it, namely this young prince:</line>
            <line>And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,</line>
            <line>Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;</line>
            <line>Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent</line>
            <line>Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;</line>
            <line>And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,</line>
            <line>With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,</line>
            <line>We will bear home that lusty blood again</line>
            <line>Which here we came to spout against your town,</line>
            <line>And leave your children, wives and you in peace.</line>
            <line>But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,</line>
            <line>'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls</line>
            <line>Can hide you from our messengers of war,</line>
            <line>Though all these English and their discipline</line>
            <line>Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.</line>
            <line>Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,</line>
            <line>In that behalf which we have challenged it?</line>
            <line>Or shall we give the signal to our rage</line>

            <line>That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,</line>
            <line>Is niece to England: look upon the years</line>
            <line>Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:</line>
            <line>If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,</line>
            <line>Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?</line>
            <line>If zealous love should go in search of virtue,</line>
            <line>Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?</line>
            <line>If love ambitious sought a match of birth,</line>
            <line>Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?</line>
            <line>Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,</line>
            <line>Is the young Dauphin every way complete:</line>
            <line>If not complete of, say he is not she;</line>
            <line>And she again wants nothing, to name want,</line>
            <line>If want it be not that she is not he:</line>
            <line>He is the half part of a blessed man,</line>
            <line>Left to be finished by such as she;</line>
            <line>And she a fair divided excellence,</line>
            <line>Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.</line>
            <line>O, two such silver currents, when they join,</line>
            <line>Do glorify the banks that bound them in;</line>
            <line>And two such shores to two such streams made one,</line>
            <line>Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,</line>
            <line>To these two princes, if you marry them.</line>
            <line>This union shall do more than battery can</line>
            <line>To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,</line>
            <line>With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,</line>
            <line>The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,</line>
            <line>And give you entrance: but without this match,</line>
            <line>The sea enraged is not half so deaf,</line>
            <line>Lions more confident, mountains and rocks</line>
            <line>More free from motion, no, not Death himself</line>

            <line>Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,</line>
            <line>That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,</line>
            <line>Talks as familiarly of roaring lions</line>

            <line>He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;</line>
            <line>He gives the bastinado with his tongue:</line>
            <line>Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his</line>
            <line>But buffets better than a fist of France:</line>

            <line>That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe</line>
            <line>The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.</line>

            <line>Brother of England, how may we content</line>

            <line>From all direction, purpose, course, intent:</line>

            <line>To a most base and vile-concluded peace.</line>
            <line>And why rail I on this Commodity?</line>
            <line>But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:</line>
            <line>Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,</line>
            <line>When his fair angels would salute my palm;</line>
            <line>But for my hand, as unattempted yet,</line>
            <line>Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.</line>
            <line>Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail</line>
            <line>And say there is no sin but to be rich;</line>
            <line>And being rich, my virtue then shall be</line>
            <line>To say there is no vice but beggary.</line>
            <line>Since kings break faith upon commodity,</line>
            <line>Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.</line>

            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!</line>
            <line>False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!</line>
            <line>Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?</line>
            <line>It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:</line>
            <line>Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:</line>
            <line>It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:</line>
            <line>I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word</line>
            <line>Is but the vain breath of a common man:</line>
            <line>Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;</line>
            <line>I have a king's oath to the contrary.</line>
            <line>Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,</line>
            <line>For I am sick and capable of fears,</line>
            <line>Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,</line>
            <line>A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,</line>
            <line>A woman, naturally born to fears;</line>
            <line>And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,</line>
            <line>With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,</line>
            <line>But they will quake and tremble all this day.</line>
            <line>What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?</line>
            <line>Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?</line>
            <line>What means that hand upon that breast of thine?</line>
            <line>Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,</line>
            <line>Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?</line>
            <line>Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?</line>
            <line>Then speak again; not all thy former tale,</line>
            <line>But this one word, whether thy tale be true.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
            <line>As true as I believe you think them false</line>
            <line>That give you cause to prove my saying true.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,</line>
            <line>Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,</line>
            <line>And let belief and life encounter so</line>
            <line>As doth the fury of two desperate men</line>
            <line>Which in the very meeting fall and die.</line>
            <line>Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?</line>
            <line>France friend with England, what becomes of me?</line>
            <line>Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:</line>
            <line>This news hath made thee a most ugly man.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
            <line>What other harm have I, good lady, done,</line>
            <line>But spoke the harm that is by others done?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>Which harm within itself so heinous is</line>
            <line>As it makes harmful all that speak of it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>I do beseech you, madam, be content.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,</line>
            <line>Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,</line>
            <line>Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,</line>
            <line>Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,</line>
            <line>Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,</line>
            <line>I would not care, I then would be content,</line>
            <line>For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou</line>
            <line>Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.</line>
            <line>But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,</line>
            <line>Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:</line>
            <line>Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,</line>
            <line>And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,</line>
            <line>She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;</line>
            <line>She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,</line>
            <line>And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France</line>
            <line>To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,</line>
            <line>And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.</line>
            <line>France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,</line>
            <line>That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!</line>
            <line>Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?</line>
            <line>Envenom him with words, or get thee gone</line>
            <line>And leave those woes alone which I alone</line>
            <line>Am bound to under-bear.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
            <line>Pardon me, madam,</line>
            <line>I may not go without you to the kings.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:</line>
            <line>I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;</line>
            <line>For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.</line>
            <line>To me and to the state of my great grief</line>
            <line>Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great</line>
            <line>That no supporter but the huge firm earth</line>
            <line>Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;</line>
            <line>Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.</line>

         <stagedir>Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILLIP, LEWIS, BLANCH,
QUEEN ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and Attendants</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
            <line>'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day</line>
            <line>Ever in France shall be kept festival:</line>
            <line>To solemnize this day the glorious sun</line>
            <line>Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,</line>
            <line>Turning with splendor of his precious eye</line>
            <line>The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:</line>
            <line>The yearly course that brings this day about</line>
            <line>Shall never see it but a holiday.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>A wicked day, and not a holy day!</line>
            <stagedir>Rising</stagedir>
            <line>What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,</line>
            <line>That it in golden letters should be set</line>
            <line>Among the high tides in the calendar?</line>
            <line>Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,</line>
            <line>This day of shame, oppression, perjury.</line>
            <line>Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child</line>
            <line>Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,</line>
            <line>Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:</line>
            <line>But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;</line>
            <line>No bargains break that are not this day made:</line>
            <line>This day, all things begun come to ill end,</line>
            <line>Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
            <line>By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause</line>
            <line>To curse the fair proceedings of this day:</line>
            <line>Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>You have beguiled me with a counterfeit</line>
            <line>Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,</line>
            <line>Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;</line>
            <line>You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,</line>
            <line>But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:</line>
            <line>The grappling vigour and rough frown of war</line>
            <line>Is cold in amity and painted peace,</line>
            <line>And our oppression hath made up this league.</line>
            <line>Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!</line>
            <line>A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!</line>
            <line>Let not the hours of this ungodly day</line>
            <line>Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,</line>
            <line>Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!</line>
            <line>Hear me, O, hear me!</line>

            <line>War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war</line>
            <line>O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame</line>
            <line>That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!</line>
            <line>Thou little valiant, great in villany!</line>

            <line>Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight</line>
            <line>But when her humorous ladyship is by</line>
            <line>To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,</line>
            <line>And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,</line>
            <line>A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear</line>
            <line>Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,</line>
            <line>Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,</line>
            <line>Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend</line>
            <line>Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,</line>
            <line>And dost thou now fall over to my fores?</line>
            <line>Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,</line>
            <line>And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.</line>

         <stagedir>Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
            <line>Here comes the holy legate of the pope.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
            <line>Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!</line>
            <line>To thee, King John, my holy errand is.</line>
            <line>I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,</line>
            <line>And from Pope Innocent the legate here,</line>
            <line>Do in his name religiously demand</line>
            <line>Why thou against the church, our holy mother,</line>
            <line>So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce</line>
            <line>Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop</line>
            <line>Of Canterbury, from that holy see?</line>
            <line>This, in our foresaid holy father's name,</line>
            <line>Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
            <line>What earthy name to interrogatories</line>
            <line>Can task the free breath of a sacred king?</line>
            <line>Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name</line>
            <line>So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,</line>
            <line>To charge me to an answer, as the pope.</line>
            <line>Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England</line>
            <line>Add thus much more, that no Italian priest</line>
            <line>Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;</line>
            <line>But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,</line>
            <line>So under Him that great supremacy,</line>
            <line>Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,</line>
            <line>Without the assistance of a mortal hand:</line>
            <line>So tell the pope, all reverence set apart</line>
            <line>To him and his usurp'd authority.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
            <line>Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
            <line>Though you and all the kings of Christendom</line>
            <line>Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,</line>
            <line>Dreading the curse that money may buy out;</line>
            <line>And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,</line>
            <line>Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,</line>
            <line>Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,</line>
            <line>Though you and all the rest so grossly led</line>
            <line>This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,</line>
            <line>Yet I alone, alone do me oppose</line>
            <line>Against the pope and count his friends my foes.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
            <line>Then, by the lawful power that I have,</line>
            <line>Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.</line>
            <line>And blessed shall he be that doth revolt</line>
            <line>From his allegiance to an heretic;</line>
            <line>And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,</line>
            <line>Canonized and worshipped as a saint,</line>
            <line>That takes away by any secret course</line>
            <line>Thy hateful life.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>O, lawful let it be</line>
            <line>That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!</line>
            <line>Good father cardinal, cry thou amen</line>
            <line>To my keen curses; for without my wrong</line>
            <line>There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
            <line>There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>And for mine too: when law can do no right,</line>
            <line>Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:</line>
            <line>Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,</line>
            <line>For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;</line>
            <line>Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,</line>
            <line>How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?</line>

            <line>Philip of France, on peril of a curse,</line>
            <line>Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;</line>
            <line>And raise the power of France upon his head,</line>
            <line>Unless he do submit himself to Rome.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
            <line>Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,</line>

            <line>Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,</line>

            <line>This royal hand and mine are newly knit,</line>

            <line>The latest breath that gave the sound of words</line>

            <line>Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,</line>
            <line>And even before this truce, but new before,</line>
            <line>No longer than we well could wash our hands</line>
            <line>To clap this royal bargain up of peace,</line>

            <line>First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,</line>
            <line>That is, to be the champion of our church!</line>
            <line>What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself</line>
            <line>And may not be performed by thyself,</line>
            <line>For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss</line>
            <line>Is not amiss when it is truly done,</line>
            <line>And being not done, where doing tends to ill,</line>
            <line>The truth is then most done not doing it:</line>
            <line>The better act of purposes mistook</line>
            <line>Is to mistake again; though indirect,</line>
            <line>Yet indirection thereby grows direct,</line>
            <line>And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire</line>
            <line>Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.</line>
            <line>It is religion that doth make vows kept;</line>
            <line>But thou hast sworn against religion,</line>
            <line>By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,</line>
            <line>And makest an oath the surety for thy truth</line>

            <line>To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;</line>
            <line>Else what a mockery should it be to swear!</line>

            <line>And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.</line>
            <line>Therefore thy later vows against thy first</line>
            <line>Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;</line>
            <line>And better conquest never canst thou make</line>
            <line>Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts</line>
            <line>Against these giddy loose suggestions:</line>
            <line>Upon which better part our prayers come in,</line>
            <line>If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know</line>
            <line>The peril of our curses light on thee</line>
            <line>So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,</line>

            <line>Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?</line>
            <line>I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud</line>

            <line>As they have given these hairs their liberty!'</line>
            <line>But now I envy at their liberty,</line>
            <line>And will again commit them to their bonds,</line>
            <line>Because my poor child is a prisoner.</line>
            <line>And, father cardinal, I have heard you say</line>
            <line>That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:</line>
            <line>If that be true, I shall see my boy again;</line>
            <line>For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,</line>
            <line>To him that did but yesterday suspire,</line>
            <line>There was not such a gracious creature born.</line>
            <line>But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud</line>
            <line>And chase the native beauty from his cheek</line>
            <line>And he will look as hollow as a ghost,</line>
            <line>As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,</line>
            <line>And so he'll die; and, rising so again,</line>
            <line>When I shall meet him in the court of heaven</line>
            <line>I shall not know him: therefore never, never</line>
            <line>Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.</line>

            <line>Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;</line>

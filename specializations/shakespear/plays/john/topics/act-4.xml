            <line>Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand</line>
            <line>Within the arras: when I strike my foot</line>
            <line>Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,</line>
            <line>And bind the boy which you shall find with me</line>

            <line>Good morrow, little prince.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>As little prince, having so great a title</line>
            <line>To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Indeed, I have been merrier.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Mercy on me!</line>
            <line>Methinks no body should be sad but I:</line>
            <line>Yet, I remember, when I was in France,</line>
            <line>Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,</line>
            <line>Only for wantonness. By my christendom,</line>
            <line>So I were out of prison and kept sheep,</line>
            <line>I should be as merry as the day is long;</line>
            <line>And so I would be here, but that I doubt</line>
            <line>My uncle practises more harm to me:</line>
            <line>He is afraid of me and I of him:</line>
            <line>Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?</line>
            <line>No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven</line>
            <line>I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.</line>

            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate</line>
            <line>He will awake my mercy which lies dead:</line>
            <line>Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.</line>

            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:</line>
            <line>In sooth, I would you were a little sick,</line>
            <line>That I might sit all night and watch with you:</line>
            <line>I warrant I love you more than you do me.</line>

            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  His words do take possession of my bosom.</line>
            <line>Read here, young Arthur.</line>
            <stagedir>Showing a paper</stagedir>
            <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>
            <line>How now, foolish rheum!</line>
            <line>Turning dispiteous torture out of door!</line>
            <line>I must be brief, lest resolution drop</line>
            <line>Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.</line>
            <line>Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:</line>
            <line>Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Young boy, I must.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>And will you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>And I will.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,</line>
            <line>I knit my handercher about your brows,</line>
            <line>The best I had, a princess wrought it me,</line>
            <line>And I did never ask it you again;</line>
            <line>And with my hand at midnight held your head,</line>
            <line>And like the watchful minutes to the hour,</line>
            <line>Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,</line>
            <line>Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'</line>
            <line>Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'</line>
            <line>Many a poor man's son would have lien still</line>
            <line>And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;</line>
            <line>But you at your sick service had a prince.</line>
            <line>Nay, you may think my love was crafty love</line>
            <line>And call it cunning: do, an if you will:</line>
            <line>If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,</line>
            <line>Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?</line>
            <line>These eyes that never did nor never shall</line>
            <line>So much as frown on you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>I have sworn to do it;</line>
            <line>And with hot irons must I burn them out.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!</line>
            <line>The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,</line>
            <line>Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears</line>
            <line>And quench his fiery indignation</line>
            <line>Even in the matter of mine innocence;</line>
            <line>Nay, after that, consume away in rust</line>
            <line>But for containing fire to harm mine eye.</line>
            <line>Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?</line>
            <line>An if an angel should have come to me</line>
            <line>And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,</line>
            <line>I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Come forth.</line>
            <stagedir>Stamps</stagedir>
            <stagedir>Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons, &amp;c</stagedir>
            <line>Do as I bid you do.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out</line>
            <line>Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?</line>
            <line>I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.</line>
            <line>For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!</line>
            <line>Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,</line>
            <line>And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;</line>
            <line>I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,</line>
            <line>Nor look upon the iron angerly:</line>
            <line>Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,</line>
            <line>Whatever torment you do put me to.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Go, stand within; let me alone with him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Executioner</speaker>
            <line>I am best pleased to be from such a deed.</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt Executioners</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Alas, I then have chid away my friend!</line>
            <line>He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:</line>
            <line>Let him come back, that his compassion may</line>
            <line>Give life to yours.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Come, boy, prepare yourself.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Is there no remedy?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>None, but to lose your eyes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,</line>
            <line>A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,</line>
            <line>Any annoyance in that precious sense!</line>
            <line>Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,</line>
            <line>Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues</line>
            <line>Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:</line>
            <line>Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;</line>
            <line>Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,</line>
            <line>So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.</line>
            <line>Though to no use but still to look on you!</line>
            <line>Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold</line>
            <line>And would not harm me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>I can heat it, boy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,</line>
            <line>Being create for comfort, to be used</line>
            <line>In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;</line>
            <line>There is no malice in this burning coal;</line>
            <line>The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out</line>
            <line>And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>But with my breath I can revive it, boy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>An if you do, you will but make it blush</line>
            <line>And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:</line>
            <line>Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;</line>
            <line>And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,</line>
            <line>Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.</line>
            <line>All things that you should use to do me wrong</line>
            <line>Deny their office: only you do lack</line>
            <line>That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,</line>
            <line>Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye</line>
            <line>For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:</line>
            <line>Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,</line>
            <line>With this same very iron to burn them out.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>O, now you look like Hubert! all this while</line>
            <line>You were disguised.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Peace; no more. Adieu.</line>
            <line>Your uncle must not know but you are dead;</line>
            <line>I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:</line>
            <line>And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,</line>
            <line>That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,</line>
            <line>Will not offend thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
            <line>O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
            <line>Silence; no more: go closely in with me:</line>

            <line>This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,</line>

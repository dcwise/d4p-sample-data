            <speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
            <line>Thus have I yielded up into your hand</line>
            <line>The circle of my glory.</line>
         </speech>

            <line>Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,</line>
            <line>And from his holiness use all your power</line>
            <line>To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.</line>
            <line>Our discontented counties do revolt;</line>
            <line>Our people quarrel with obedience,</line>
            <line>Swearing allegiance and the love of soul</line>
            <line>To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.</line>
            <line>This inundation of mistemper'd humour</line>
            <line>Rests by you only to be qualified:</line>
            <line>Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,</line>
            <line>That present medicine must be minister'd,</line>
            <line>Or overthrow incurable ensues.</line>

            <speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
            <line>It was my breath that blew this tempest up,</line>
            <line>Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;</line>
            <line>But since you are a gentle convertite,</line>
            <line>My tongue shall hush again this storm of war</line>
            <line>And make fair weather in your blustering land.</line>
            <line>On this Ascension-day, remember well,</line>
            <line>Upon your oath of service to the pope,</line>
            <line>Go I to make the French lay down their arms.</line>

            <line>Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet</line>
            <line>Say that before Ascension-day at noon</line>
            <line>My crown I should give off? Even so I have:</line>
            <line>I did suppose it should be on constraint:</line>

            <speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
            <line>All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out</line>
            <line>But Dover castle: London hath received,</line>
            <line>Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:</line>
            <line>Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone</line>
            <line>To offer service to your enemy,</line>
            <line>And wild amazement hurries up and down</line>
            <line>The little number of your doubtful friends.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
            <line>Would not my lords return to me again,</line>

            <speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
            <line>They found him dead and cast into the streets,</line>
            <line>An empty casket, where the jewel of life</line>
            <line>By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
            <line>That villain Hubert told me he did live.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
            <line>So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.</line>
            <line>But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?</line>
            <line>Be great in act, as you have been in thought;</line>
            <line>Let not the world see fear and sad distrust</line>
            <line>Govern the motion of a kingly eye:</line>
            <line>Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;</line>
            <line>Threaten the threatener and outface the brow</line>
            <line>Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,</line>
            <line>That borrow their behaviors from the great,</line>
            <line>Grow great by your example and put on</line>
            <line>The dauntless spirit of resolution.</line>
            <line>Away, and glister like the god of war,</line>
            <line>When he intendeth to become the field:</line>
            <line>Show boldness and aspiring confidence.</line>
            <line>What, shall they seek the lion in his den,</line>
            <line>And fright him there? and make him tremble there?</line>
            <line>O, let it not be said: forage, and run</line>
            <line>To meet displeasure farther from the doors,</line>
            <line>And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
            <line>The legate of the pope hath been with me,</line>
            <line>And I have made a happy peace with him;</line>

            <line>O inglorious league!</line>
            <line>Shall we, upon the footing of our land,</line>
            <line>Send fair-play orders and make compromise,</line>
            <line>Insinuation, parley and base truce</line>
            <line>To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,</line>
            <line>A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,</line>
            <line>And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,</line>
            <line>Mocking the air with colours idly spread,</line>
            <line>And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:</line>
            <line>Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;</line>
            <line>Or if he do, let it at least be said</line>
            <line>They saw we had a purpose of defence.</line>

            <speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
            <line>Have thou the ordering of this present time.</line>

            <line>And such as to my claim are liable,</line>
            <line>Sweat in this business and maintain this war?</line>
            <line>Have I not heard these islanders shout out</line>
            <line>'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?</line>
            <line>Have I not here the best cards for the game,</line>

            <line>He is prepared, and reason too he should:</line>
            <line>This apish and unmannerly approach,</line>
            <line>This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,</line>
            <line>This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,</line>
            <line>The king doth smile at; and is well prepared</line>
            <line>To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,</line>
            <line>From out the circle of his territories.</line>
            <line>That hand which had the strength, even at your door,</line>

            <line>It is too late: the life of all his blood</line>
            <line>Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,</line>
            <line>Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,</line>
            <line>Doth by the idle comments that it makes</line>
            <line>Foretell the ending of mortality.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
            <line>His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief</line>
            <line>That, being brought into the open air,</line>
            <line>It would allay the burning quality</line>
            <line>Of that fell poison which assaileth him.</line>

            <line>Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,</line>
            <line>Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now</line>
            <line>Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds</line>
            <line>With many legions of strange fantasies,</line>
            <line>Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,</line>
            <line>Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death</line>
            <line>should sing.</line>
            <line>I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,</line>
            <line>Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,</line>
            <line>And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings</line>

            <line>There is so hot a summer in my bosom,</line>
            <line>That all my bowels crumble up to dust:</line>
            <line>I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen</line>

            <line>Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:</line>

            <line>To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,</line>
            <line>Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course</line>

            <line>To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips</line>
            <line>And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,</line>
            <line>I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait</line>

            <line>O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:</line>
            <line>The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,</line>
            <line>And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail</line>

            <line>To push destruction and perpetual shame</line>
            <line>Out of the weak door of our fainting land.</line>

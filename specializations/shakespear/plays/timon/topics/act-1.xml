            <line>Ay, that's well known:</line>

            <line>A thing slipp'd idly from me.</line>
            <line>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</line>
            <line>From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint</line>
            <line>Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame</line>

            <line>Admirable: how this grace</line>
            <line>Speaks his own standing! what a mental power</line>
            <line>This eye shoots forth! how big imagination</line>

            <speaker>Poet</speaker>
            <line>I will say of it,</line>

            <line>I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,</line>
            <line>Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</line>

            <line>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</line>
            <line>All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer</line>

            <line>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</line>
            <line>Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount</line>
            <line>Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,</line>
            <line>That labour on the bosom of this sphere</line>

            <line>To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</line>

            <line>Most honour'd Timon,</line>
            <line>It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,</line>
            <line>And call him to long peace.</line>
            <line>He is gone happy, and has left me rich:</line>
            <line>Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</line>
            <line>To your free heart, I do return those talents,</line>

            <line>O, by no means,</line>
            <line>Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:</line>
            <line>I gave it freely ever; and there's none</line>
            <line>Can truly say he gives, if he receives:</line>
            <line>If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</line>

            <line>Ceremony was but devised at first</line>

            <line>They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond</line>
            <line>man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,</line>
            <line>therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;</line>
            <line>prithee, let my meat make thee silent.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
            <line>I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should</line>
            <line>ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of</line>
            <line>men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me</line>
            <line>to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;</line>
            <line>and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.</line>
            <line>I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:</line>
            <line>Methinks they should invite them without knives;</line>
            <line>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.</line>
            <line>There's much example for't; the fellow that sits</line>
            <line>next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the</line>
            <line>breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest</line>
            <line>man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a</line>
            <line>huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;</line>
            <line>Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:</line>
            <line>Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</line>

            <line>This and my food are equals; there's no odds:</line>
            <line>Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.</line>

            <line>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;</line>
            <line>I pray for no man but myself:</line>
            <line>Grant I may never prove so fond,</line>
            <line>To trust man on his oath or bond;</line>
            <line>Or a harlot, for her weeping;</line>
            <line>Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:</line>
            <line>Or a keeper with my freedom;</line>
            <line>Or my friends, if I should need 'em.</line>
            <line>Amen. So fall to't:</line>
            <line>Rich men sin, and I eat root.</line>
            <stagedir>Eats and drinks</stagedir>
            <line>Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</line>

            <line>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods</line>
            <line>themselves have provided that I shall have much help</line>
            <line>from you: how had you been my friends else? why</line>
            <line>have you that charitable title from thousands, did</line>
            <line>not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told</line>
            <line>more of you to myself than you can with modesty</line>
            <line>speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm</line>
            <line>you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any</line>
            <line>friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they</line>
            <line>were the most needless creatures living, should we</line>
            <line>ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble</line>
            <line>sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their</line>
            <line>sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished</line>
            <line>myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We</line>
            <line>are born to do benefits: and what better or</line>
            <line>properer can we can our own than the riches of our</line>
            <line>friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have</line>
            <line>so many, like brothers, commanding one another's</line>
            <line>fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!</line>
            <line>Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to</line>

            <line>My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate</line>
            <line>Newly alighted, and come to visit you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>They are fairly welcome.</line>

            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>I beseech your honour,</line>
            <line>Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:</line>
            <line>I prithee, let's be provided to show them</line>
            <line>entertainment.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  I scarce know how.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter a Second Servant</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
            <line>May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,</line>
            <line>Out of his free love, hath presented to you</line>
            <line>Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>I shall accept them fairly; let the presents</line>
            <line>Be worthily entertain'd.</line>
            <stagedir>Enter a third Servant</stagedir>
            <line>How now! what news?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Servant</speaker>
            <line>Please you, my lord, that honourable</line>
            <line>gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company</line>
            <line>to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour</line>
            <line>two brace of greyhounds.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,</line>
            <line>Not without fair reward.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>                What will this come to?</line>
            <line>He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,</line>
            <line>And all out of an empty coffer:</line>
            <line>Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,</line>
            <line>To show him what a beggar his heart is,</line>
            <line>Being of no power to make his wishes good:</line>
            <line>His promises fly so beyond his state</line>
            <line>That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes</line>
            <line>For every word: he is so kind that he now</line>
            <line>Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.</line>
            <line>Well, would I were gently put out of office</line>
            <line>Before I were forced out!</line>
            <line>Happier is he that has no friend to feed</line>
            <line>Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.</line>
            <line>I bleed inwardly for my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>You do yourselves</line>
            <line>Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:</line>
            <line>Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>With more than common thanks I will receive it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
            <line>O, he's the very soul of bounty!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>And now I remember, my lord, you gave</line>
            <line>Good words the other day of a bay courser</line>
            <line>I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man</line>
            <line>Can justly praise but what he does affect:</line>
            <line>I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;</line>
            <line>I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>All Lords</speaker>
            <line>O, none so welcome.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>I take all and your several visitations</line>
            <line>So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;</line>
            <line>Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,</line>
            <line>And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,</line>
            <line>Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;</line>
            <line>It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living</line>
            <line>Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast</line>
            <line>Lie in a pitch'd field.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
            <line>Ay, defiled land, my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Lord</speaker>
            <line>We are so virtuously bound--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>And so</line>
            <line>Am I to you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>So infinitely endear'd--</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Lord</speaker>
            <line>The best of happiness,</line>
            <line>Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>Ready for his friends.</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
            <line>What a coil's here!</line>
            <line>Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!</line>
            <line>I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums</line>
            <line>That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:</line>
            <line>Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,</line>
            <line>Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be</line>
            <line>good to thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
            <line>No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,</line>
            <line>there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then</line>
            <line>thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,</line>
            <line>Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in</line>
            <line>paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and</line>
            <line>vain-glories?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am</line>
            <line>sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come</line>

            <line>I'll lock thy heaven from thee.</line>
            <line>O, that men's ears should be</line>

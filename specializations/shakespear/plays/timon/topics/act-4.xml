            <line>Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,</line>
            <line>That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,</line>
            <line>And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!</line>
            <line>Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,</line>
            <line>Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,</line>
            <line>And minister in their steads! to general filths</line>
            <line>Convert o' the instant, green virginity,</line>
            <line>Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;</line>
            <line>Rather than render back, out with your knives,</line>
            <line>And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!</line>
            <line>Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,</line>
            <line>And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;</line>
            <line>Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,</line>
            <line>pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,</line>
            <line>With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,</line>
            <line>Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,</line>
            <line>Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,</line>

            <line>Decline to your confounding contraries,</line>
            <line>And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,</line>
            <line>Your potent and infectious fevers heap</line>
            <line>On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,</line>
            <line>Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt</line>
            <line>As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty</line>
            <line>Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,</line>
            <line>That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,</line>
            <line>And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,</line>
            <line>Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop</line>
            <line>Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,</line>
            <line>at their society, as their friendship, may</line>
            <line>merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,</line>
            <line>But nakedness, thou detestable town!</line>
            <line>Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!</line>
            <line>Timon will to the woods; where he shall find</line>
            <line>The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.</line>
            <line>The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--</line>
            <line>The Athenians both within and out that wall!</line>

            <line>Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,</line>
            <line>As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,</line>
            <line>'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;</line>

            <stagedir>Servants embrace, and part several ways</stagedir>
            <line>O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!</line>
            <line>Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,</line>

            <line>But in a dream of friendship?</line>
            <line>To have his pomp and all what state compounds</line>

            <line>Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,</line>
            <line>Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,</line>
            <line>When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!</line>
            <line>Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?</line>

            <line>My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,</line>
            <line>Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes</line>
            <line>Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!</line>
            <line>He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat</line>
            <line>Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to</line>
            <line>Supply his life, or that which can command it.</line>
            <line>I'll follow and inquire him out:</line>

            <line>Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;</line>
            <line>Be as a planetary plague, when Jove</line>
            <line>Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison</line>
            <line>In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:</line>
            <line>Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;</line>
            <line>He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;</line>
            <line>It is her habit only that is honest,</line>
            <line>Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek</line>

            <line>That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,</line>
            <line>Are not within the leaf of pity writ,</line>
            <line>But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,</line>

            <line>O you gods!</line>
            <line>Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?</line>
            <line>Full of decay and failing? O monument</line>
            <line>And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!</line>
            <line>What an alteration of honour</line>
            <line>Has desperate want made!</line>
            <line>What viler thing upon the earth than friends</line>
            <line>Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!</line>
            <line>How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,</line>
            <line>When man was wish'd to love his enemies!</line>
            <line>Grant I may ever love, and rather woo</line>
            <line>Those that would mischief me than those that do!</line>
            <line>Has caught me in his eye: I will present</line>
            <line>My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,</line>
            <line>Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!</line>

            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>Away! what art thou?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>Have you forgot me, sir?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;</line>
            <line>Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>An honest poor servant of yours.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>Then I know thee not:</line>
            <line>I never had honest man about me, I; all</line>
            <line>I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>The gods are witness,</line>
            <line>Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief</line>
            <line>For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I</line>
            <line>love thee,</line>
            <line>Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st</line>
            <line>Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give</line>
            <line>But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:</line>
            <line>Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>I beg of you to know me, good my lord,</line>
            <line>To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts</line>
            <line>To entertain me as your steward still.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>Had I a steward</line>
            <line>So true, so just, and now so comfortable?</line>
            <line>It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.</line>
            <line>Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man</line>
            <line>Was born of woman.</line>
            <line>Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,</line>
            <line>You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim</line>
            <line>One honest man--mistake me not--but one;</line>
            <line>No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.</line>
            <line>How fain would I have hated all mankind!</line>
            <line>And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,</line>
            <line>I fell with curses.</line>
            <line>Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;</line>
            <line>For, by oppressing and betraying me,</line>
            <line>Thou mightst have sooner got another service:</line>
            <line>For many so arrive at second masters,</line>
            <line>Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--</line>
            <line>For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--</line>
            <line>Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,</line>
            <line>If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,</line>
            <line>Expecting in return twenty for one?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>No, my most worthy master; in whose breast</line>
            <line>Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:</line>
            <line>You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:</line>
            <line>Suspect still comes where an estate is least.</line>
            <line>That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,</line>
            <line>Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,</line>
            <line>Care of your food and living; and, believe it,</line>
            <line>My most honour'd lord,</line>
            <line>For any benefit that points to me,</line>
            <line>Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange</line>
            <line>For this one wish, that you had power and wealth</line>
            <line>To requite me, by making rich yourself.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,</line>
            <line>Here, take: the gods out of my misery</line>
            <line>Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;</line>
            <line>But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;</line>
            <line>Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,</line>
            <line>But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,</line>
            <line>Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs</line>
            <line>What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,</line>
            <line>Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like</line>
            <line>blasted woods,</line>
            <line>And may diseases lick up their false bloods!</line>
            <line>And so farewell and thrive.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
            <line>O, let me stay,</line>
            <line>And comfort you, my master.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TIMON</speaker>
            <line>If thou hatest curses,</line>
            <line>Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:</line>
            <line>Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.</line>

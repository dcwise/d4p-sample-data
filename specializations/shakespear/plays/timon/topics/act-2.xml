            <line>And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore</line>
            <line>He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,</line>
            <line>Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion</line>
            <line>Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.</line>
            <line>If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,</line>
            <line>And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.</line>
            <line>If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more</line>
            <line>Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,</line>
            <line>Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,</line>
            <line>And able horses. No porter at his gate,</line>
            <line>But rather one that smiles and still invites</line>
            <line>All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason</line>

            <line>My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn</line>
            <line>Out of mine own; his days and times are past</line>

            <line>Put on a most importunate aspect,</line>
            <line>A visage of demand; for, I do fear,</line>
            <line>When every feather sticks in his own wing,</line>
            <line>Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,</line>

            <line>At many times I brought in my accounts,</line>

            <line>When, for some trifling present, you have bid me</line>
            <line>Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;</line>
            <line>Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you</line>
            <line>To hold your hand more close: I did endure</line>
            <line>Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have</line>
            <line>Prompted you in the ebb of your estate</line>

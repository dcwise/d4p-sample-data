            <line>Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's</line>
            <line>knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their</line>
            <line>mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to</line>
            <line>Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met</line>
            <line>the jealous knave their master in the door, who</line>
            <line>asked them once or twice what they had in their</line>
            <line>basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave</line>
            <line>would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he</line>
            <line>should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he</line>
            <line>for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But</line>
            <line>mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs</line>
            <line>of three several deaths; first, an intolerable</line>
            <line>fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten</line>
            <line>bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good</line>
            <line>bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to</line>
            <line>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,</line>
            <line>like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes</line>
            <line>that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a</line>
            <line>man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject</line>
            <line>to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution</line>
            <line>and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.</line>
            <line>And in the height of this bath, when I was more than</line>
            <line>half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be</line>
            <line>thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,</line>

            <line>Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I</line>
            <line>sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!</line>
            <line>there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.</line>
            <line>This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen</line>
            <line>and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself</line>
            <line>what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my</line>
            <line>house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he</line>
            <line>should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,</line>
            <line>nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that</line>
            <line>guides him should aid him, I will search</line>
            <line>impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,</line>
            <line>yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:</line>
            <line>if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go</line>
            <line>with me: I'll be horn-mad.</line>

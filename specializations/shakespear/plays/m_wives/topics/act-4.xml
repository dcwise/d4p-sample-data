            <line>and how my transformation hath been washed and</line>
            <line>cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by</line>
            <line>drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant</line>
            <line>they would whip me with their fine wits till I were</line>
            <line>as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered</line>
            <line>since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my</line>
            <line>wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.</line>

            <line>To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,</line>
            <line>Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;</line>
            <line>The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,</line>
            <line>While other jests are something rank on foot,</line>
            <line>Her father hath commanded her to slip</line>
            <line>Away with Slender and with him at Eton</line>
            <line>Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,</line>
            <line>Her mother, ever strong against that match</line>
            <line>And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed</line>
            <line>That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</line>
            <line>While other sports are tasking of their minds,</line>
            <line>And at the deanery, where a priest attends,</line>
            <line>Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot</line>
            <line>She seemingly obedient likewise hath</line>
            <line>Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:</line>
            <line>Her father means she shall be all in white,</line>
            <line>And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</line>
            <line>To take her by the hand and bid her go,</line>
            <line>She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,</line>
            <line>The better to denote her to the doctor,</line>
            <line>For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,</line>
            <line>That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,</line>
            <line>With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;</line>
            <line>And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</line>
            <line>To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,</line>
            <line>The maid hath given consent to go with him.</line>

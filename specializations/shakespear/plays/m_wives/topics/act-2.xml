            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-</line>
            <line>time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?</line>
            <line>Let me see.</line>
            <stagedir>Reads</stagedir>
            <line>'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though</line>
            <line>Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him</line>
            <line>not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more</line>
            <line>am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,</line>
            <line>so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you</line>
            <line>love sack, and so do I; would you desire better</line>
            <line>sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at</line>
            <line>the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--</line>
            <line>that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis</line>
            <line>not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,</line>
            <line>Thine own true knight,</line>
            <line>By day or night,</line>
            <line>Or any kind of light,</line>
            <line>With all his might</line>
            <line>For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'</line>
            <line>What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked</line>
            <line>world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with</line>
            <line>age to show himself a young gallant! What an</line>
            <line>unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard</line>
            <line>picked--with the devil's name!--out of my</line>
            <line>conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?</line>
            <line>Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What</line>
            <line>should I say to him? I was then frugal of my</line>
            <line>mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill</line>
            <line>in the parliament for the putting down of men. How</line>
            <line>shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,</line>
            <line>as sure as his guts are made of puddings.</line>

            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very</line>
            <line>ill.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>Faith, but you do, in my mind.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the</line>
            <line>contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>What's the matter, woman?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I</line>
            <line>could come to such honour!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is</line>
            <line>it? dispense with trifles; what is it?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,</line>
            <line>I could be knighted.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights</line>
            <line>will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the</line>
            <line>article of thy gentry.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I</line>
            <line>might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat</line>
            <line>men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of</line>
            <line>men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised</line>
            <line>women's modesty; and gave such orderly and</line>
            <line>well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I</line>
            <line>would have sworn his disposition would have gone to</line>
            <line>the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere</line>
            <line>and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to</line>
            <line>the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,</line>
            <line>threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his</line>
            <line>belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged</line>
            <line>on him? I think the best way were to entertain him</line>
            <line>with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted</line>
            <line>him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and</line>
            <line>Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery</line>
            <line>of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy</line>
            <line>letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I</line>
            <line>protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a</line>
            <line>thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for</line>
            <line>different names--sure, more,--and these are of the</line>
            <line>second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;</line>
            <line>for he cares not what he puts into the press, when</line>
            <line>he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,</line>
            <line>and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you</line>
            <line>twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very</line>
            <line>words. What doth he think of us?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to</line>
            <line>wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain</line>
            <line>myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;</line>
            <line>for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I</line>
            <line>know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him</line>
            <line>above deck.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>So will I if he come under my hatches, I'll never</line>
            <line>to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's</line>
            <line>appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in</line>
            <line>his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,</line>
            <line>till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,</line>
            <line>that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,</line>
            <line>that my husband saw this letter! it would give</line>
            <line>eternal food to his jealousy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's</line>
            <line>as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;</line>
            <line>and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
            <line>You are the happier woman.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
            <line>Let's consult together against this greasy knight.</line>
            <line>Come hither.</line>

            <line>He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,</line>

            <line>The horn, I say. Farewell.</line>
            <line>Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:</line>
            <line>Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.</line>
            <line>Away, Sir Corporal Nym!</line>
            <line>Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.</line>

            <line>
               <stagedir>To PAGE</stagedir>  And this is true; I like not the humour</line>
            <line>of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I</line>
            <line>should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I</line>
            <line>have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.</line>
            <line>He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.</line>
            <line>My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis</line>
            <line>true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.</line>

            <line>Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage</line>

            <line>observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;</line>
            <line>fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly</line>
            <line>give me sight of her; not only bought many presents</line>
            <line>to give her, but have given largely to many to know</line>
            <line>what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued</line>
            <line>her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the</line>

            <line>be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite</line>
            <line>rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</line>

            <line>with any detection in my hand, my desires had</line>
            <line>instance and argument to commend themselves: I</line>
            <line>could drive her then from the ward of her purity,</line>
            <line>her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand</line>
            <line>other her defences, which now are too too strongly</line>

            <speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
            <line>I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner</line>
            <line>have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without</line>
            <line>scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without</line>
            <line>impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-</line>
            <line>out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with</line>
            <line>a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-</line>

            <line>Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his</line>
            <line>discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye</line>
            <line>ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general</line>
            <line>behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is</line>
            <line>too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it</line>
            <line>were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
            <line>He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer</line>
            <line>than the staple of his argument. I abhor such</line>
            <line>fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and</line>
            <line>point-devise companions; such rackers of</line>
            <line>orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should</line>
            <line>say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,</line>
            <line>e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;</line>
            <line>half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh</line>
            <line>abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he</line>
            <line>would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of</line>
            <line>insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.</line>

            <line>head: and among other important and most serious</line>
            <line>designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let</line>
            <line>that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his</line>
            <line>grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor</line>

            <line>with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet</line>
            <line>heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no</line>
            <line>fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his</line>
            <line>greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of</line>
            <line>travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.</line>
            <line>The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do</line>

            <line>Under the cool shade of a sycamore</line>

            <line>When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,</line>
            <line>Toward that shade I might behold addrest</line>
            <line>The king and his companions: warily</line>
            <line>I stole into a neighbour thicket by,</line>
            <line>And overheard what you shall overhear,</line>
            <line>That, by and by, disguised they will be here.</line>
            <line>Their herald is a pretty knavish page,</line>
            <line>That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:</line>
            <line>Action and accent did they teach him there;</line>
            <line>'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'</line>
            <line>And ever and anon they made a doubt</line>
            <line>Presence majestical would put him out,</line>
            <line>'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;</line>

            <line>The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;</line>
            <line>I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'</line>
            <line>With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,</line>
            <line>Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:</line>
            <line>One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore</line>
            <line>A better speech was never spoke before;</line>
            <line>Another, with his finger and his thumb,</line>
            <line>Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'</line>
            <line>The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'</line>
            <line>The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.</line>
            <line>With that, they all did tumble on the ground,</line>

            <line>They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.</line>

            <line>Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;</line>

            <line>Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,</line>

            <line>Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,</line>
            <line>So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.</line>
            <line>And change your favours too; so shall your loves</line>

            <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
            <line>The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:</line>

            <line>And mock for mock is only my intent.</line>
            <line>Their several counsels they unbosom shall</line>
            <line>To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal</line>

            <line>This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,</line>
            <line>And utters it again when God doth please:</line>
            <line>He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares</line>
            <line>At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;</line>

            <line>We four indeed confronted were with four</line>
            <line>In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,</line>
            <line>And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,</line>
            <line>They did not bless us with one happy word.</line>
            <line>I dare not call them fools; but this I think,</line>

            <line>With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,</line>
            <line>By light we lose light: your capacity</line>
            <line>Is of that nature that to your huge store</line>

            <line>By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--</line>
            <line>Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd</line>

            <line>By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,</line>

            <line>My faith and this the princess I did give:</line>

            <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
            <line>Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BIRON</speaker>
            <line>Neither of either; I remit both twain.</line>
            <line>I see the trick on't: here was a consent,</line>
            <line>Knowing aforehand of our merriment,</line>
            <line>To dash it like a Christmas comedy:</line>
            <line>Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,</line>
            <line>Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,</line>
            <line>That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick</line>
            <line>To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,</line>
            <line>Told our intents before; which once disclosed,</line>
            <line>The ladies did change favours: and then we,</line>
            <line>Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.</line>
            <line>Now, to our perjury to add more terror,</line>
            <line>We are again forsworn, in will and error.</line>
            <line>Much upon this it is: and might not you</line>

            <line>No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,</line>
            <line>Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:</line>
            <line>If for my love, as there is no such cause,</line>
            <line>You will do aught, this shall you do for me:</line>
            <line>Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed</line>
            <line>To some forlorn and naked hermitage,</line>
            <line>Remote from all the pleasures of the world;</line>

            <line>Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,</line>
            <line>But that it bear this trial and last love;</line>
            <line>Then, at the expiration of the year,</line>
            <line>Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,</line>
            <line>And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine</line>
            <line>I will be thine; and till that instant shut</line>
            <line>My woeful self up in a mourning house,</line>
            <line>Raining the tears of lamentation</line>
            <line>For the remembrance of my father's death.</line>

            <line>A jest's prosperity lies in the ear</line>
            <line>Of him that hears it, never in the tongue</line>
            <line>Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,</line>

            <line>Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,</line>

            <line>give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately</line>
            <line>hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.</line>

            <speaker>MOTH</speaker>
            <line>No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at</line>
            <line>the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour</line>
            <line>it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and</line>
            <line>sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you</line>
            <line>swallowed love with singing love, sometime through</line>
            <line>the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling</line>
            <line>love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of</line>
            <line>your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly</line>
            <line>doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in</line>
            <line>your pocket like a man after the old painting; and</line>
            <line>keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.</line>
            <line>These are complements, these are humours; these</line>
            <line>betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without</line>
            <line>these; and make them men of note--do you note</line>
            <line>me?--that most are affected to these.</line>

            <line>It must be done this afternoon.</line>
            <line>Hark, slave, it is but this:</line>
            <line>The princess comes to hunt here in the park,</line>
            <line>And in her train there is a gentle lady;</line>
            <line>When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,</line>
            <line>And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;</line>
            <line>And to her white hand see thou do commend</line>
            <line>This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.</line>

            <line>And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;</line>
            <line>A very beadle to a humorous sigh;</line>
            <line>A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;</line>
            <line>A domineering pedant o'er the boy;</line>
            <line>Than whom no mortal so magnificent!</line>
            <line>This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;</line>
            <line>This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;</line>
            <line>Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,</line>
            <line>The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,</line>
            <line>Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,</line>
            <line>Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,</line>
            <line>Sole imperator and great general</line>
            <line>Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--</line>
            <line>And I to be a corporal of his field,</line>
            <line>And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!</line>
            <line>What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!</line>
            <line>A woman, that is like a German clock,</line>
            <line>Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,</line>
            <line>And never going aright, being a watch,</line>
            <line>But being watch'd that it may still go right!</line>
            <line>Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;</line>
            <line>And, among three, to love the worst of all;</line>
            <line>A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,</line>
            <line>With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;</line>
            <line>Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed</line>
            <line>Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:</line>
            <line>And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!</line>
            <line>To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague</line>
            <line>That Cupid will impose for my neglect</line>
            <line>Of his almighty dreadful little might.</line>
            <line>Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:</line>
            <line>Some men must love my lady and some Joan.</line>

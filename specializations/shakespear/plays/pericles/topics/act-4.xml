            <line>Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,</line>
            <line>Welcomed and settled to his own desire.</line>
            <line>His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,</line>
            <line>Unto Diana there a votaress.</line>
            <line>Now to Marina bend your mind,</line>
            <line>Whom our fast-growing scene must find</line>
            <line>At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd</line>
            <line>In music, letters; who hath gain'd</line>
            <line>Of education all the grace,</line>
            <line>Which makes her both the heart and place</line>
            <line>Of general wonder. But, alack,</line>
            <line>That monster envy, oft the wrack</line>
            <line>Of earned praise, Marina's life</line>
            <line>Seeks to take off by treason's knife.</line>
            <line>And in this kind hath our Cleon</line>
            <line>One daughter, and a wench full grown,</line>
            <line>Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid</line>
            <line>Hight Philoten: and it is said</line>
            <line>For certain in our story, she</line>
            <line>Would ever with Marina be:</line>
            <line>Be't when she weaved the sleided silk</line>
            <line>With fingers long, small, white as milk;</line>
            <line>Or when she would with sharp needle wound</line>
            <line>The cambric, which she made more sound</line>
            <line>By hurting it; or when to the lute</line>
            <line>She sung, and made the night-bird mute,</line>
            <line>That still records with moan; or when</line>
            <line>She would with rich and constant pen</line>
            <line>Vail to her mistress Dian; still</line>
            <line>This Philoten contends in skill</line>
            <line>With absolute Marina: so</line>
            <line>With the dove of Paphos might the crow</line>
            <line>Vie feathers white. Marina gets</line>
            <line>All praises, which are paid as debts,</line>
            <line>And not as given. This so darks</line>
            <line>In Philoten all graceful marks,</line>
            <line>That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,</line>
            <line>A present murderer does prepare</line>
            <line>For good Marina, that her daughter</line>
            <line>Might stand peerless by this slaughter.</line>
            <line>The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,</line>
            <line>Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:</line>
            <line>And cursed Dionyza hath</line>
            <line>The pregnant instrument of wrath</line>
            <line>Prest for this blow. The unborn event</line>
            <line>I do commend to your content:</line>
            <line>Only I carry winged time</line>
            <line>Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;</line>
            <line>Which never could I so convey,</line>
            <line>Unless your thoughts went on my way.</line>
            <line>Dionyza does appear,</line>
            <line>With Leonine, a murderer.</line>

            <line>Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,</line>

            <line>Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.</line>

            <line>Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;</line>
            <line>Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;</line>
            <line>Making, to take your imagination,</line>
            <line>From bourn to bourn, region to region.</line>
            <line>By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime</line>
            <line>To use one language in each several clime</line>
            <line>Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you</line>
            <line>To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,</line>
            <line>The stages of our story. Pericles</line>
            <line>Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,</line>
            <line>Attended on by many a lord and knight.</line>
            <line>To see his daughter, all his life's delight.</line>
            <line>Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late</line>
            <line>Advanced in time to great and high estate,</line>
            <line>Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,</line>
            <line>Old Helicanus goes along behind.</line>
            <line>Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought</line>
            <line>This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;</line>
            <line>So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--</line>
            <line>To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.</line>
            <line>Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;</line>
            <line>Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.</line>
            <subhead>DUMB SHOW.</subhead>
            <stagedir>Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;
CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows
PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes
lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty
passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA</stagedir>
            <line>See how belief may suffer by foul show!</line>
            <line>This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;</line>
            <line>And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,</line>
            <line>With sighs shot through, and biggest tears</line>
            <line>o'ershower'd,</line>
            <line>Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears</line>
            <line>Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:</line>
            <line>He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears</line>
            <line>A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,</line>
            <line>And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.</line>
            <line>The epitaph is for Marina writ</line>
            <line>By wicked Dionyza.</line>
            <stagedir>Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument</stagedir>
            <line>'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,</line>
            <line>Who wither'd in her spring of year.</line>
            <line>She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,</line>
            <line>On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;</line>
            <line>Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,</line>
            <line>Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:</line>
            <line>Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,</line>
            <line>Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:</line>
            <line>Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,</line>
            <line>Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'</line>
            <line>No visor does become black villany</line>
            <line>So well as soft and tender flattery.</line>
            <line>Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,</line>
            <line>And bear his courses to be ordered</line>
            <line>By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play</line>
            <line>His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day</line>
            <line>In her unholy service. Patience, then,</line>

            <line>Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;</line>
            <line>No din but snores the house about,</line>
            <line>Made louder by the o'er-fed breast</line>
            <line>Of this most pompous marriage-feast.</line>
            <line>The cat, with eyne of burning coal,</line>
            <line>Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;</line>
            <line>And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,</line>
            <line>E'er the blither for their drouth.</line>
            <line>Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.</line>
            <line>Where, by the loss of maidenhead,</line>
            <line>A babe is moulded. Be attent,</line>
            <line>And time that is so briefly spent</line>
            <line>With your fine fancies quaintly eche:</line>
            <line>What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.</line>
            <subhead>DUMB SHOW.</subhead>
            <stagedir>Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with
Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and
gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it
SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter
THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The
KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and
PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with
LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt
SIMONIDES and the rest</stagedir>
            <line>By many a dern and painful perch</line>
            <line>Of Pericles the careful search,</line>
            <line>By the four opposing coigns</line>
            <line>Which the world together joins,</line>
            <line>Is made with all due diligence</line>
            <line>That horse and sail and high expense</line>
            <line>Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,</line>
            <line>Fame answering the most strange inquire,</line>
            <line>To the court of King Simonides</line>
            <line>Are letters brought, the tenor these:</line>
            <line>Antiochus and his daughter dead;</line>
            <line>The men of Tyrus on the head</line>
            <line>Of Helicanus would set on</line>
            <line>The crown of Tyre, but he will none:</line>
            <line>The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;</line>
            <line>Says to 'em, if King Pericles</line>
            <line>Come not home in twice six moons,</line>
            <line>He, obedient to their dooms,</line>
            <line>Will take the crown. The sum of this,</line>
            <line>Brought hither to Pentapolis,</line>
            <line>Y-ravished the regions round,</line>
            <line>And every one with claps can sound,</line>
            <line>'Our heir-apparent is a king!</line>
            <line>Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'</line>
            <line>Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:</line>
            <line>His queen with child makes her desire--</line>
            <line>Which who shall cross?--along to go:</line>
            <line>Omit we all their dole and woe:</line>
            <line>Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,</line>
            <line>And so to sea. Their vessel shakes</line>
            <line>On Neptune's billow; half the flood</line>
            <line>Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood</line>
            <line>Varies again; the grisly north</line>
            <line>Disgorges such a tempest forth,</line>
            <line>That, as a duck for life that dives,</line>
            <line>So up and down the poor ship drives:</line>
            <line>The lady shrieks, and well-a-near</line>
            <line>Does fall in travail with her fear:</line>
            <line>And what ensues in this fell storm</line>
            <line>Shall for itself itself perform.</line>
            <line>I nill relate, action may</line>
            <line>Conveniently the rest convey;</line>
            <line>Which might not what by me is told.</line>

            <line>Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;</line>
            <line>It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love</line>

            <speaker>First Sailor</speaker>
            <line>Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,</line>
            <line>the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be</line>

            <line>Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still</line>

            <line>briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.</line>

            <line>Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,</line>
            <line>My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander</line>
            <line>Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe</line>

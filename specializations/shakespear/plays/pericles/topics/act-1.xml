            <line>To sing a song that old was sung,</line>
            <line>From ashes ancient Gower is come;</line>
            <line>Assuming man's infirmities,</line>
            <line>To glad your ear, and please your eyes.</line>
            <line>It hath been sung at festivals,</line>
            <line>On ember-eves and holy-ales;</line>
            <line>And lords and ladies in their lives</line>
            <line>Have read it for restoratives:</line>

            <line>I life would wish, and that I might</line>

            <line>This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great</line>
            <line>Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:</line>
            <line>The fairest in all Syria,</line>
            <line>I tell you what mine authors say:</line>
            <line>This king unto him took a fere,</line>
            <line>Who died and left a female heir,</line>
            <line>So buxom, blithe, and full of face,</line>
            <line>As heaven had lent her all his grace;</line>
            <line>With whom the father liking took,</line>
            <line>And her to incest did provoke:</line>
            <line>Bad child; worse father! to entice his own</line>
            <line>To evil should be done by none:</line>
            <line>But custom what they did begin</line>
            <line>Was with long use account no sin.</line>
            <line>The beauty of this sinful dame</line>
            <line>Made many princes thither frame,</line>
            <line>To seek her as a bed-fellow,</line>
            <line>In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:</line>
            <line>Which to prevent he made a law,</line>
            <line>To keep her still, and men in awe,</line>
            <line>That whoso ask'd her for his wife,</line>
            <line>His riddle told not, lost his life:</line>
            <line>So for her many a wight did die,</line>
            <line>As yon grim looks do testify.</line>
            <line>What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye</line>
            <line>I give, my cause who best can justify.</line>

            <line>I sought a husband, in which labour</line>

            <line>How they may be, and yet in two,</line>
            <line>As you will live, resolve it you.</line>
            <line>Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers</line>

            <line>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,</line>
            <line>If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?</line>

            <line>Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:</line>
            <line>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt</line>
            <line>For he's no man on whom perfections wait</line>
            <line>That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</line>
            <line>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;</line>

            <line>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.</line>
            <line>For that's an article within our law,</line>
            <line>As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:</line>

            <line>He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:</line>
            <line>For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.</line>
            <line>Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;</line>
            <line>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</line>
            <line>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:</line>
            <line>To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts</line>
            <line>Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd</line>
            <line>By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.</line>

            <line>The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,</line>
            <line>Be my so used a guest as not an hour,</line>
            <line>In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,</line>
            <line>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</line>
            <line>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</line>
            <line>And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,</line>
            <line>Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:</line>
            <line>Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,</line>
            <line>Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.</line>
            <line>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</line>
            <line>That have their first conception by mis-dread,</line>
            <line>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</line>
            <line>And what was first but fear what might be done,</line>
            <line>Grows elder now and cares it be not done.</line>
            <line>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</line>
            <line>'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</line>
            <line>Since he's so great can make his will his act,</line>
            <line>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</line>
            <line>Nor boots it me to say I honour him.</line>
            <line>If he suspect I may dishonour him:</line>
            <line>And what may make him blush in being known,</line>
            <line>He'll stop the course by which it might be known;</line>
            <line>With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,</line>
            <line>And with the ostent of war will look so huge,</line>
            <line>Amazement shall drive courage from the state;</line>
            <line>Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,</line>
            <line>And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:</line>
            <line>Which care of them, not pity of myself,</line>
            <line>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</line>
            <line>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</line>
            <line>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</line>
            <line>And punish that before that he would punish.</line>

            <line>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</line>
            <line>Thought nought too curious, are ready now</line>
            <line>To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</line>
            <line>So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife</line>
            <line>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:</line>
            <line>Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;</line>
            <line>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</line>
            <line>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</line>

            <line>Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,</line>

            <speaker>Lord</speaker>
            <line>We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,</line>

            <line>That may succeed as his inheritor;</line>

            <line>Taking advantage of our misery,</line>
            <line>Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,</line>
            <line>To beat us down, the which are down already;</line>
            <line>And make a conquest of unhappy me,</line>
            <line>Whereas no glory's got to overcome.</line>

            <speaker>Lord</speaker>
            <line>That's the least fear; for, by the semblance</line>

            <line>The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.</line>
            <line>Go tell their general we attend him here,</line>

            <line>We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,</line>

            <line>Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,</line>

            <line>And these our ships, you happily may think</line>
            <line>Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within</line>
            <line>With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,</line>
            <line>Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,</line>

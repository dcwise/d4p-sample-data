            <line>Hear me, queen:</line>
            <line>The strong necessity of time commands</line>
            <line>Our services awhile; but my full heart</line>
            <line>Remains in use with you. Our Italy</line>
            <line>Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius</line>
            <line>Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:</line>
            <line>Equality of two domestic powers</line>
            <line>Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,</line>
            <line>Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,</line>
            <line>Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,</line>
            <line>Into the hearts of such as have not thrived</line>
            <line>Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;</line>
            <line>And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge</line>
            <line>By any desperate change: my more particular,</line>

            <line>Sovereign of Egypt, hail!</line>

            <speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
            <line>How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!</line>
            <line>Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath</line>
            <line>With his tinct gilded thee.</line>
            <line>How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
            <line>Last thing he did, dear queen,</line>
            <line>He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--</line>
            <line>This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.</line>

            <speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
            <line>'Good friend,' quoth he,</line>
            <line>'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends</line>
            <line>This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,</line>
            <line>To mend the petty present, I will piece</line>
            <line>Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,</line>
            <line>Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,</line>
            <line>And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,</line>
            <line>Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke</line>
            <line>Was beastly dumb'd by him.</line>

            <line>Like to the time o' the year between the extremes</line>

            <line>O well-divided disposition! Note him,</line>
            <line>Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:</line>
            <line>He was not sad, for he would shine on those</line>
            <line>That make their looks by his; he was not merry,</line>
            <line>Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay</line>
            <line>In Egypt with his joy; but between both:</line>
            <line>O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,</line>
            <line>The violence of either thee becomes,</line>
            <line>So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?</line>

            <line>Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.</line>
            <line>Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,</line>

            <line>Noble Ventidius,</line>
            <line>Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,</line>
            <line>The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,</line>
            <line>Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither</line>
            <line>The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony</line>
            <line>Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and</line>
            <line>Put garlands on thy head.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>VENTIDIUS</speaker>
            <line>O Silius, Silius,</line>
            <line>I have done enough; a lower place, note well,</line>
            <line>May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;</line>
            <line>Better to leave undone, than by our deed</line>
            <line>Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.</line>
            <line>Caesar and Antony have ever won</line>
            <line>More in their officer than person: Sossius,</line>
            <line>One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,</line>
            <line>For quick accumulation of renown,</line>
            <line>Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.</line>
            <line>Who does i' the wars more than his captain can</line>
            <line>Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,</line>
            <line>The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,</line>
            <line>Than gain which darkens him.</line>
            <line>I could do more to do Antonius good,</line>
            <line>But 'twould offend him; and in his offence</line>
            <line>Should my performance perish.</line>

            <line>Without the which a soldier, and his sword,</line>
            <line>Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!</line>

            <line>How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,</line>

            <line>I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord</line>
            <line>Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.</line>

            <line>Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force</line>
            <line>The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;</line>
            <line>There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,</line>

            <line>Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,</line>
            <line>Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood</line>
            <line>The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,</line>

            <line>Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,</line>

            <line>Some way to leave him.</line>

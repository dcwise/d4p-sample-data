      <p>This is shaksper.200, a set of the plays of William Shakespeare
        marked up for electronic publication.  The set began as ASCII files
        put into the public domain by Moby Lexical Tools in 1992.  They were
        marked up in 1992 as a beginner's exercise in SGML DTD and stylesheet
        design (originally using the DynaText proprietary stylesheet language)
        and in 1996 were released along with a companion set of publicly
        available religious texts as the earliest examples of real documents
        marked up in (early) XML.  The current distribution conforms to the
        XML 1.0 Recommendation released February 8, 1998.</p>
      
      <p><b>Caveat regarding Shakespeare scholarship</b></p>
      
      <p>Every time I have occasion to compare the text of these files with
        a modern edition of Shakespeare (usually when someone points out a
        problem that requires me to check against a printed text), I wonder
        where in the world the Moby folks got the original.  They must have
        used OCR to scan in a printed edition that had gone out of copyright,
        which means that the source could have been published no later than
        World War I.  My guess is that it was a late Victorian edition, but it
        might have been much older.</p>
      
      <p>In any case, the editorial style of the set is very different from
        that of modern editions, and on general principles I strongly doubt
        the critical accuracy of the text.  The set is provided, as it always
        has been, purely as a learning exercise in SGML/XML markup, as a
        benchmark for comparing the performance of SGML/XML processors, and as
        a resource for testing stylesheet and search methodologies.  The text
        is enjoyable reading, but the present edition should not be relied
        upon for scholarly purposes.</p>
      
      <p><b>Copyright</b></p>
      
      <p>While the text has been in the public domain since 1992, the status
        of the markup hasn't been clear.  For purposes of legal simplicity (I
        think), I'm now asserting copyright over the markup to discourage the
        circulation of variant versions while still allowing free
        distribution.  Each play now includes the following notice:</p>

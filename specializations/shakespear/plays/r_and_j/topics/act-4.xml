         <stagedir>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
            <line>On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>My father Capulet will have it so;</line>
            <line>And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
            <line>You say you do not know the lady's mind:</line>
            <line>Uneven is the course, I like it not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,</line>
            <line>And therefore have I little talk'd of love;</line>
            <line>For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.</line>
            <line>Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous</line>
            <line>That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,</line>
            <line>And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,</line>
            <line>To stop the inundation of her tears;</line>
            <line>Which, too much minded by herself alone,</line>
            <line>May be put from her by society:</line>
            <line>Now do you know the reason of this haste.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.</line>
            <line>Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.</line>

            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.</line>

            <line>What must be shall be.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
            <line>That's a certain text.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>Come you to make confession to this father?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>To answer that, I should confess to you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>Do not deny to him that you love me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>I will confess to you that I love him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>If I do so, it will be of more price,</line>
            <line>Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>The tears have got small victory by that;</line>
            <line>For it was bad enough before their spite.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;</line>
            <line>And what I spake, I spake it to my face.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>It may be so, for it is not mine own.</line>
            <line>Are you at leisure, holy father, now;</line>
            <line>Or shall I come to you at evening mass?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
            <line>My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.</line>
            <line>My lord, we must entreat the time alone.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PARIS</speaker>
            <line>God shield I should disturb devotion!</line>
            <line>Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:</line>
            <line>Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,</line>
            <line>Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
            <line>Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;</line>
            <line>It strains me past the compass of my wits:</line>
            <line>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,</line>
            <line>On Thursday next be married to this county.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,</line>
            <line>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:</line>
            <line>If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,</line>
            <line>Do thou but call my resolution wise,</line>
            <line>And with this knife I'll help it presently.</line>
            <line>God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;</line>
            <line>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,</line>
            <line>Shall be the label to another deed,</line>
            <line>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt</line>
            <line>Turn to another, this shall slay them both:</line>
            <line>Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,</line>
            <line>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,</line>
            <line>'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife</line>
            <line>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that</line>
            <line>Which the commission of thy years and art</line>
            <line>Could to no issue of true honour bring.</line>
            <line>Be not so long to speak; I long to die,</line>
            <line>If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
            <line>Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,</line>
            <line>Which craves as desperate an execution.</line>
            <line>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</line>
            <line>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</line>
            <line>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</line>
            <line>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake</line>
            <line>A thing like death to chide away this shame,</line>
            <line>That copest with death himself to scape from it:</line>
            <line>And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</line>
            <line>From off the battlements of yonder tower;</line>
            <line>Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk</line>
            <line>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;</line>
            <line>Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,</line>
            <line>O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,</line>
            <line>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;</line>
            <line>Or bid me go into a new-made grave</line>
            <line>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;</line>
            <line>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;</line>
            <line>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</line>
            <line>To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
            <line>Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent</line>
            <line>To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:</line>
            <line>To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;</line>
            <line>Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:</line>
            <line>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</line>
            <line>And this distilled liquor drink thou off;</line>
            <line>When presently through all thy veins shall run</line>
            <line>A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse</line>
            <line>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:</line>
            <line>No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;</line>
            <line>The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</line>
            <line>To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,</line>
            <line>Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;</line>
            <line>Each part, deprived of supple government,</line>
            <line>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:</line>
            <line>And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death</line>
            <line>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</line>
            <line>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</line>
            <line>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</line>
            <line>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:</line>
            <line>Then, as the manner of our country is,</line>
            <line>In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier</line>
            <line>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</line>
            <line>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</line>
            <line>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</line>
            <line>Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</line>
            <line>And hither shall he come: and he and I</line>
            <line>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</line>
            <line>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</line>
            <line>And this shall free thee from this present shame;</line>
            <line>If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,</line>
            <line>Abate thy valour in the acting it.</line>

            <line>To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.</line>

            <line>Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,</line>

            <line>I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,</line>

            <line>O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,</line>
            <line>Environed with all these hideous fears?</line>
            <line>And madly play with my forefather's joints?</line>
            <line>And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?</line>
            <line>And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,</line>
            <line>As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?</line>
            <line>O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost</line>
            <line>Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body</line>

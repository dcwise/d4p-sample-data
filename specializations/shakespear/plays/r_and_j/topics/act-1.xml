            <line>Two households, both alike in dignity,</line>
            <line>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</line>
            <line>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</line>
            <line>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</line>
            <line>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</line>
            <line>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</line>
            <line>Whole misadventured piteous overthrows</line>
            <line>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</line>
            <line>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</line>
            <line>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</line>
            <line>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</line>
            <line>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</line>

            <line>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</line>

         <stagedir>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
armed with swords and bucklers</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
            <line>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
            <line>No, for then we should be colliers.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
            <line>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
            <line>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
            <line>I strike quickly, being moved.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
            <line>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
            <line>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
            <line>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:</line>
            <line>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
            <line>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
            <line>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,</line>
            <line>are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push</line>
            <line>Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids</line>
            <line>to the wall.</line>

            <speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
            <line>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I</line>

            <line>maids, and cut off their heads.</line>

            <line>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
            <line>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;</line>

            <line>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</line>
            <line>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--</line>
            <line>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,</line>
            <line>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</line>
            <line>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</line>
            <line>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</line>
            <line>Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,</line>
            <line>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</line>
            <line>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</line>
            <line>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</line>
            <line>Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,</line>
            <line>And made Verona's ancient citizens</line>
            <line>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</line>
            <line>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</line>
            <line>Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:</line>
            <line>If ever you disturb our streets again,</line>
            <line>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</line>
            <line>For this time, all the rest depart away:</line>
            <line>You Capulet; shall go along with me:</line>
            <line>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</line>
            <line>To know our further pleasure in this case,</line>
            <line>To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</line>
            <line>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO</stagedir>
         <speech>

            <line>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</line>
            <line>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
            <line>Here were the servants of your adversary,</line>
            <line>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:</line>
            <line>I drew to part them: in the instant came</line>
            <line>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,</line>
            <line>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</line>
            <line>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</line>
            <line>Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:</line>
            <line>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</line>
            <line>Came more and more and fought on part and part,</line>
            <line>Till the prince came, who parted either part.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LADY MONTAGUE</speaker>
            <line>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?</line>
            <line>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
            <line>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun</line>
            <line>Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,</line>
            <line>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;</line>
            <line>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</line>
            <line>That westward rooteth from the city's side,</line>
            <line>So early walking did I see your son:</line>
            <line>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me</line>
            <line>And stole into the covert of the wood:</line>
            <line>I, measuring his affections by my own,</line>
            <line>That most are busied when they're most alone,</line>
            <line>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,</line>
            <line>And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
            <line>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</line>
            <line>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.</line>
            <line>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</line>
            <line>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</line>
            <line>Should in the furthest east begin to draw</line>
            <line>The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,</line>
            <line>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,</line>
            <line>And private in his chamber pens himself,</line>
            <line>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out</line>
            <line>And makes himself an artificial night:</line>
            <line>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</line>
            <line>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
            <line>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
            <line>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
            <line>Have you importuned him by any means?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
            <line>Both by myself and many other friends:</line>
            <line>But he, his own affections' counsellor,</line>
            <line>Is to himself--I will not say how true--</line>
            <line>But to himself so secret and so close,</line>
            <line>So far from sounding and discovery,</line>
            <line>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</line>
            <line>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</line>
            <line>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</line>
            <line>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.</line>
            <line>We would as willingly give cure as know.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter ROMEO</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
            <line>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;</line>
            <line>I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.</line>

            <line>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</line>
            <line>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;</line>
            <line>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;</line>
            <line>Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:</line>
            <line>What is it else? a madness most discreet,</line>

            <line>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit</line>
            <line>With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;</line>
            <line>And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,</line>
            <line>From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.</line>
            <line>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</line>
            <line>Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,</line>
            <line>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:</line>
            <line>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,</line>
            <line>That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</line>
         </speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,</line>
            <line>For beauty starved with her severity</line>
            <line>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</line>
            <line>She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</line>
            <line>To merit bliss by making me despair:</line>
            <line>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</line>

            <line>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</line>
            <line>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:</line>
            <line>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</line>
            <line>What doth her beauty serve, but as a note</line>
            <line>Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?</line>

            <line>My lord and you were then at Mantua:--</line>

            <line>To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!</line>

            <line>And since that time it is eleven years;</line>
            <line>For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,</line>
            <line>She could have run and waddled all about;</line>
            <line>For even the day before, she broke her brow:</line>

            <line>A' was a merry man--took up the child:</line>
            <line>'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?</line>

            <line>Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,</line>
            <line>The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'</line>

            <line>I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,</line>
            <line>I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;</line>

            <line>A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;</line>
            <line>A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:</line>

            <line>Drawn with a team of little atomies</line>
            <line>Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;</line>
            <line>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,</line>
            <line>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</line>
            <line>The traces of the smallest spider's web,</line>
            <line>The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,</line>
            <line>Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,</line>
            <line>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,</line>
            <line>Not so big as a round little worm</line>

            <line>And in this state she gallops night by night</line>
            <line>Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;</line>
            <line>O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,</line>
            <line>O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,</line>
            <line>O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,</line>
            <line>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</line>
            <line>Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:</line>
            <line>Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,</line>
            <line>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</line>
            <line>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail</line>
            <line>Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,</line>
            <line>Then dreams, he of another benefice:</line>
            <line>Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,</line>
            <line>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</line>
            <line>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</line>
            <line>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon</line>
            <line>Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</line>
            <line>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</line>
            <line>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</line>
            <line>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</line>
            <line>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</line>
            <line>Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</line>
            <line>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</line>

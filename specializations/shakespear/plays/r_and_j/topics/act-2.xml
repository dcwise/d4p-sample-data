            <line>Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,</line>
            <line>And young affection gapes to be his heir;</line>
            <line>That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,</line>
            <line>With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.</line>
            <line>Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,</line>
            <line>Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,</line>
            <line>But to his foe supposed he must complain,</line>
            <line>And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:</line>
            <line>Being held a foe, he may not have access</line>
            <line>To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;</line>
            <line>And she as much in love, her means much less</line>
            <line>To meet her new-beloved any where:</line>
            <line>But passion lends them power, time means, to meet</line>
            <line>Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.</line>

            <line>Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:</line>
            <line>Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;</line>
            <line>Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'</line>

            <line>That were some spite: my invocation</line>
            <line>Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name</line>
            <line>I conjure only but to raise up him.</line>

            <line>But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?</line>
            <line>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.</line>
            <line>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,</line>
            <line>Who is already sick and pale with grief,</line>
            <line>That thou her maid art far more fair than she:</line>
            <line>Be not her maid, since she is envious;</line>
            <line>Her vestal livery is but sick and green</line>
            <line>And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.</line>
            <line>It is my lady, O, it is my love!</line>

            <line>She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?</line>
            <line>Her eye discourses; I will answer it.</line>
            <line>I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:</line>
            <line>Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</line>
            <line>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</line>
            <line>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.</line>
            <line>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</line>
            <line>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,</line>
            <line>As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven</line>
            <line>Would through the airy region stream so bright</line>
            <line>That birds would sing and think it were not night.</line>
            <line>See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!</line>
            <line>O, that I were a glove upon that hand,</line>

            <line>Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes</line>
            <line>Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him</line>
            <line>When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds</line>

            <line>Deny thy father and refuse thy name;</line>
            <line>Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,</line>

            <line>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</line>
            <line>What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,</line>
            <line>Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part</line>
            <line>Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!</line>
            <line>What's in a name? that which we call a rose</line>
            <line>By any other name would smell as sweet;</line>
            <line>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,</line>
            <line>Retain that dear perfection which he owes</line>
            <line>Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,</line>
            <line>And for that name which is no part of thee</line>

            <line>So stumblest on my counsel?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>By a name</line>
            <line>I know not how to tell thee who I am:</line>
            <line>My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,</line>
            <line>Because it is an enemy to thee;</line>
            <line>Had I it written, I would tear the word.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words</line>
            <line>Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:</line>
            <line>Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</line>

            <line>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?</line>
            <line>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,</line>
            <line>And the place death, considering who thou art,</line>
            <line>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;</line>
            <line>For stony limits cannot hold love out,</line>
            <line>And what love can do that dares love attempt;</line>
            <line>Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</line>

            <line>Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye</line>
            <line>Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,</line>
            <line>And I am proof against their enmity.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>I would not for the world they saw thee here.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;</line>
            <line>And but thou love me, let them find me here:</line>
            <line>My life were better ended by their hate,</line>
            <line>Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;</line>
            <line>He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.</line>
            <line>I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far</line>
            <line>As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,</line>
            <line>I would adventure for such merchandise.</line>

            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,</line>
            <line>Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek</line>
            <line>For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night</line>
            <line>Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny</line>
            <line>What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!</line>
            <line>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'</line>
            <line>And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,</line>
            <line>Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries</line>
            <line>Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,</line>
            <line>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:</line>
            <line>Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,</line>
            <line>I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,</line>
            <line>So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.</line>
            <line>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</line>
            <line>And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:</line>
            <line>But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true</line>
            <line>Than those that have more cunning to be strange.</line>
            <line>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</line>
            <line>But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,</line>
            <line>My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,</line>
            <line>And not impute this yielding to light love,</line>
            <line>Which the dark night hath so discovered.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,</line>

            <line>Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</line>

            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>Do not swear at all;</line>
            <line>Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,</line>
            <line>Which is the god of my idolatry,</line>
            <line>And I'll believe thee.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,</line>
            <line>I have no joy of this contract to-night:</line>
            <line>It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;</line>
            <line>Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be</line>
            <line>Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!</line>
            <line>This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,</line>
            <line>May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.</line>
            <line>Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest</line>
            <line>Come to thy heart as that within my breast!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>JULIET</speaker>
            <line>I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:</line>

            <line>But to be frank, and give it thee again.</line>

            <line>The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,</line>
            <line>Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,</line>
            <line>And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels</line>
            <line>From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:</line>
            <line>Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</line>
            <line>The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,</line>
            <line>I must up-fill this osier cage of ours</line>
            <line>With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.</line>
            <line>The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;</line>
            <line>What is her burying grave that is her womb,</line>
            <line>And from her womb children of divers kind</line>

            <line>Many for many virtues excellent,</line>
            <line>None but for some and yet all different.</line>
            <line>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</line>
            <line>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:</line>
            <line>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</line>
            <line>But to the earth some special good doth give,</line>
            <line>Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use</line>
            <line>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:</line>
            <line>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;</line>

            <line>Within the infant rind of this small flower</line>
            <line>Poison hath residence and medicine power:</line>
            <line>For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;</line>
            <line>Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.</line>

            <line>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,</line>
            <line>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:</line>
            <line>My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;</line>
            <line>And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit</line>
            <line>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</line>
            <line>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--</line>
            <line>Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave</line>
            <line>to think!--</line>
            <line>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,</line>
            <line>That I revived, and was an emperor.</line>
            <line>Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,</line>
            <line>When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!</line>
            <stagedir>Enter BALTHASAR, booted</stagedir>
            <line>News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!</line>
            <line>Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?</line>
            <line>How doth my lady? Is my father well?</line>
            <line>How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;</line>
            <line>For nothing can be ill, if she be well.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
            <line>Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:</line>
            <line>Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,</line>
            <line>And her immortal part with angels lives.</line>
            <line>I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,</line>
            <line>And presently took post to tell it you:</line>
            <line>O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,</line>
            <line>Since you did leave it for my office, sir.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!</line>
            <line>Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,</line>
            <line>And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
            <line>I do beseech you, sir, have patience:</line>
            <line>Your looks are pale and wild, and do import</line>
            <line>Some misadventure.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>Tush, thou art deceived:</line>
            <line>Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.</line>
            <line>Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
            <line>No, my good lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>No matter: get thee gone,</line>
            <line>And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit BALTHASAR</stagedir>
            <line>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.</line>
            <line>Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift</line>
            <line>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!</line>
            <line>I do remember an apothecary,--</line>
            <line>And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted</line>
            <line>In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,</line>
            <line>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,</line>
            <line>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:</line>
            <line>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</line>
            <line>An alligator stuff'd, and other skins</line>
            <line>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</line>
            <line>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</line>
            <line>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</line>
            <line>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</line>
            <line>Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.</line>
            <line>Noting this penury, to myself I said</line>
            <line>'An if a man did need a poison now,</line>
            <line>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</line>
            <line>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'</line>
            <line>O, this same thought did but forerun my need;</line>
            <line>And this same needy man must sell it me.</line>
            <line>As I remember, this should be the house.</line>
            <line>Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.</line>
            <line>What, ho! apothecary!</line>

            <speaker>Apothecary</speaker>
            <line>Who calls so loud?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:</line>
            <line>Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have</line>
            <line>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear</line>
            <line>As will disperse itself through all the veins</line>
            <line>That the life-weary taker may fall dead</line>
            <line>And that the trunk may be discharged of breath</line>
            <line>As violently as hasty powder fired</line>
            <line>Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Apothecary</speaker>
            <line>Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law</line>
            <line>Is death to any he that utters them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,</line>
            <line>And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,</line>
            <line>Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,</line>
            <line>Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;</line>
            <line>The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;</line>
            <line>The world affords no law to make thee rich;</line>
            <line>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Apothecary</speaker>
            <line>My poverty, but not my will, consents.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Apothecary</speaker>
            <line>Put this in any liquid thing you will,</line>
            <line>And drink it off; and, if you had the strength</line>
            <line>Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
            <line>There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,</line>
            <line>Doing more murders in this loathsome world,</line>
            <line>Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.</line>
            <line>I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.</line>
            <line>Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.</line>
            <line>Come, cordial and not poison, go with me</line>
            <line>To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.</line>

            <line>Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!</line>
            <line>What said my man, when my betossed soul</line>
            <line>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</line>
            <line>He told me Paris should have married Juliet:</line>
            <line>Said he not so? or did I dream it so?</line>
            <line>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,</line>
            <line>To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,</line>
            <line>One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!</line>
            <line>I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;</line>
            <line>A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,</line>
            <line>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes</line>
            <line>This vault a feasting presence full of light.</line>
            <line>Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.</line>
            <stagedir>Laying PARIS in the tomb</stagedir>
            <line>How oft when men are at the point of death</line>
            <line>Have they been merry! which their keepers call</line>
            <line>A lightning before death: O, how may I</line>
            <line>Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!</line>
            <line>Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,</line>
            <line>Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:</line>
            <line>Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet</line>
            <line>Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,</line>
            <line>And death's pale flag is not advanced there.</line>
            <line>Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?</line>
            <line>O, what more favour can I do to thee,</line>
            <line>Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain</line>
            <line>To sunder his that was thine enemy?</line>
            <line>Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,</line>
            <line>Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe</line>
            <line>That unsubstantial death is amorous,</line>
            <line>And that the lean abhorred monster keeps</line>
            <line>Thee here in dark to be his paramour?</line>
            <line>For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;</line>
            <line>And never from this palace of dim night</line>
            <line>Depart again: here, here will I remain</line>
            <line>With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here</line>
            <line>Will I set up my everlasting rest,</line>
            <line>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</line>
            <line>From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!</line>
            <line>Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you</line>
            <line>The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss</line>
            <line>A dateless bargain to engrossing death!</line>
            <line>Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!</line>
            <line>Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on</line>
            <line>The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!</line>
            <line>Here's to my love!</line>
            <stagedir>Drinks</stagedir>
            <line>O true apothecary!</line>
            <line>Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.</line>

            <line>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</line>
            <line>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</line>
            <line>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</line>
            <line>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</line>
            <line>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</line>
            <line>Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</line>
            <line>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</line>
            <line>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</line>
            <line>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</line>
            <line>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</line>
            <line>And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</line>
            <line>To rid her from this second marriage,</line>
            <line>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</line>
            <line>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</line>
            <line>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</line>
            <line>As I intended, for it wrought on her</line>
            <line>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</line>
            <line>That he should hither come as this dire night,</line>
            <line>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</line>
            <line>Being the time the potion's force should cease.</line>
            <line>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</line>
            <line>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</line>
            <line>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</line>
            <line>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</line>
            <line>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</line>
            <line>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</line>
            <line>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</line>
            <line>But when I came, some minute ere the time</line>
            <line>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</line>
            <line>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</line>
            <line>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</line>

            <line>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</line>
            <line>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</line>
            <line>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</line>
            <line>All this I know; and to the marriage</line>
            <line>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</line>
            <line>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</line>
            <line>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</line>
            <line>Unto the rigour of severest law.</line>

            <line>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;</line>
            <line>And then in post he came from Mantua</line>
            <line>To this same place, to this same monument.</line>
            <line>This letter he early bid me give his father,</line>
            <line>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</line>
            <line>I departed not and left him there.</line>

            <line>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;</line>
            <line>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:</line>
            <line>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;</line>
            <line>And by and by my master drew on him;</line>
            <line>And then I ran away to call the watch.</line>

            <line>This letter doth make good the friar's words,</line>
            <line>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:</line>
            <line>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</line>
            <line>Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal</line>
            <line>Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</line>
            <line>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</line>
            <line>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</line>
            <line>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</line>

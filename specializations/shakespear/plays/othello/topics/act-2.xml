            <line>What from the cape can you discern at sea?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;</line>
            <line>I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,</line>
            <line>Descry a sail.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
            <line>Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;</line>
            <line>A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:</line>
            <line>If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,</line>
            <line>What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,</line>
            <line>Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>A segregation of the Turkish fleet:</line>
            <line>For do but stand upon the foaming shore,</line>
            <line>The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;</line>
            <line>The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,</line>
            <line>seems to cast water on the burning bear,</line>
            <line>And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:</line>
            <line>I never did like molestation view</line>
            <line>On the enchafed flood.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
            <line>If that the Turkish fleet</line>
            <line>Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:</line>
            <line>It is impossible they bear it out.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter a third Gentleman</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>News, lads! our wars are done.</line>
            <line>The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,</line>
            <line>That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice</line>
            <line>Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance</line>
            <line>On most part of their fleet.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
            <line>How! is this true?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>The ship is here put in,</line>
            <line>A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,</line>
            <line>Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,</line>
            <line>Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,</line>
            <line>And is in full commission here for Cyprus.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTANO</speaker>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort</line>
            <line>Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,</line>
            <line>And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted</line>
            <line>With foul and violent tempest.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
            <line>Pray heavens he be;</line>
            <line>For I have served him, and the man commands</line>
            <line>Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!</line>
            <line>As well to see the vessel that's come in</line>
            <line>As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,</line>
            <line>Even till we make the main and the aerial blue</line>
            <line>An indistinct regard.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Come, let's do so:</line>
            <line>For every minute is expectancy</line>
            <line>Of more arrivance.</line>

            <line>Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,</line>
            <line>That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens</line>
            <line>Give him defence against the elements,</line>
            <line>For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
            <line>Is he well shipp'd?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot</line>
            <line>Of very expert and approved allowance;</line>
            <line>Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,</line>
            <line>Stand in bold cure.</line>
         </speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Fourth Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea</line>
            <line>Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>My hopes do shape him for the governor.</line>

            <line>Our friends at least.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>I pray you, sir, go forth,</line>
            <line>And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid</line>
            <line>That paragons description and wild fame;</line>
            <line>One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,</line>
            <line>And in the essential vesture of creation</line>
            <line>Does tire the ingener.</line>
            <stagedir>Re-enter second Gentleman</stagedir>
            <line>How now! who has put in?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>Has had most favourable and happy speed:</line>
            <line>Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,</line>
            <line>The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--</line>
            <line>Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--</line>
            <line>As having sense of beauty, do omit</line>
            <line>Their mortal natures, letting go safely by</line>
            <line>The divine Desdemona.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MONTANO</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,</line>
            <line>Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,</line>
            <line>Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts</line>
            <line>A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,</line>
            <line>And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,</line>
            <line>That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,</line>
            <line>Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,</line>
            <line>Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits</line>
            <line>And bring all Cyprus comfort!</line>

Attendants</stagedir>
            <line>O, behold,</line>
            <line>The riches of the ship is come on shore!</line>
            <line>Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>O, but I fear--How lost you company?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>The great contention of the sea and skies</line>

            <line>Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,</line>
            <line>That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding</line>

         <stagedir>Kissing her</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Sir, would she give you so much of her lips</line>
            <line>As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,</line>
            <line>You'll have enough.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>Alas, she has no speech.</line>

            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>In faith, too much;</line>
            <line>I find it still, when I have list to sleep:</line>
            <line>Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,</line>
            <line>She puts her tongue a little in her heart,</line>
            <line>And chides with thinking.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
            <line>You have little cause to say so.</line>

            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,</line>
            <line>Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,</line>
            <line>Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,</line>
            <line>Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
            <line>You shall not write my praise.</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>O gentle lady, do not put me to't;</line>
            <line>For I am nothing, if not critical.</line>

         <speech>

            <line>Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?</line>

            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>I am not merry; but I do beguile</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>I am about it; but indeed my invention</line>
            <line>Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;</line>
            <line>It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,</line>
            <line>And thus she is deliver'd.</line>
            <line>If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,</line>
            <line>The one's for use, the other useth it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>Well praised! How if she be black and witty?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>If she be black, and thereto have a wit,</line>
            <line>She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>She never yet was foolish that was fair;</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'</line>
            <line>the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.</line>
            <line>But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving</line>
            <line>woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her</line>
            <line>merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>She that was ever fair and never proud,</line>
            <line>Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,</line>
            <line>Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,</line>
            <line>Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'</line>
            <line>She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,</line>
            <line>Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,</line>
            <line>She that in wisdom never was so frail</line>
            <line>To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;</line>
            <line>She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,</line>
            <line>See suitors following and not look behind,</line>
            <line>She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn</line>

            <line>and will she love him still for prating? let not</line>
            <line>thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;</line>
            <line>and what delight shall she have to look on the</line>
            <line>devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of</line>
            <line>sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to</line>
            <line>give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,</line>
            <line>sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which</line>
            <line>the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these</line>
            <line>required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will</line>
            <line>find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,</line>
            <line>disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will</line>
            <line>instruct her in it and compel her to some second</line>
            <line>choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most</line>

            <line>eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio</line>
            <line>does? a knave very voluble; no further</line>

            <line>civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing</line>
            <line>of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,</line>
            <line>none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a</line>
            <line>finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and</line>
            <line>counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never</line>
            <line>present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the</line>
            <line>knave is handsome, young, and hath all those</line>
            <line>requisites in him that folly and green minds look</line>
            <line>after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman</line>

            <line>for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows</line>

            <line>too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what</line>

            <line>For that I do suspect the lusty Moor</line>

            <line>Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,</line>
            <line>To manage private and domestic quarrel,</line>
            <line>In night, and on the court and guard of safety!</line>

            <line>Touch me not so near:</line>
            <line>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</line>
            <line>Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;</line>
            <line>Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth</line>
            <line>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.</line>
            <line>Montano and myself being in speech,</line>
            <line>There comes a fellow crying out for help:</line>
            <line>And Cassio following him with determined sword,</line>
            <line>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</line>
            <line>Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:</line>
            <line>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</line>
            <line>Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--</line>
            <line>The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,</line>
            <line>Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather</line>
            <line>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</line>
            <line>And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night</line>

            <line>For this was brief--I found them close together,</line>
            <line>At blow and thrust; even as again they were</line>
            <line>When you yourself did part them.</line>
            <line>More of this matter cannot I report:</line>
            <line>But men are men; the best sometimes forget:</line>
            <line>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</line>
            <line>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</line>
            <line>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received</line>

            <line>imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without</line>
            <line>deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,</line>
            <line>unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!</line>
            <line>there are ways to recover the general again: you</line>

            <line>I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,</line>
            <line>such an answer would stop them all. To be now a</line>

            <line>I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife</line>

            <line>contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and</line>
            <line>graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune</line>

            <line>so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,</line>
            <line>she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more</line>

            <line>When this advice is free I give and honest,</line>
            <line>Probal to thinking and indeed the course</line>
            <line>To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy</line>
            <line>The inclining Desdemona to subdue</line>
            <line>In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful</line>
            <line>As the free elements. And then for her</line>
            <line>To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,</line>
            <line>All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,</line>
            <line>His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,</line>
            <line>That she may make, unmake, do what she list,</line>
            <line>Even as her appetite shall play the god</line>
            <line>With his weak function. How am I then a villain</line>
            <line>To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,</line>
            <line>Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!</line>

            <line>They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</line>

            <line>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</line>
            <line>I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,</line>
            <line>That she repeals him for her body's lust;</line>
            <line>And by how much she strives to do him good,</line>
            <line>She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</line>
            <line>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</line>
            <line>And out of her own goodness make the net</line>

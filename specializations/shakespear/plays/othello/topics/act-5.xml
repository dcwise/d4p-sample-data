            <line>Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--</line>
            <line>It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;</line>

            <line>Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,</line>
            <line>And love thee after. One more, and this the last:</line>
            <line>So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,</line>

            <line>Yes, presently:</line>

            <line>Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,</line>

            <line>Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;</line>
            <line>Man but a rush against Othello's breast,</line>
            <line>And he retires. Where should Othello go?</line>
            <line>Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!</line>
            <line>Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,</line>
            <line>This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,</line>
            <line>And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!</line>
            <line>Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!</line>
            <line>Whip me, ye devils,</line>
            <line>From the possession of this heavenly sight!</line>
            <line>Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!</line>
            <line>Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!</line>

            <line>Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,</line>
            <line>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</line>
            <line>Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;</line>
            <line>And here another: the one of them imports</line>
            <line>The death of Cassio to be undertook</line>
            <line>By Roderigo.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>

            <line>Now here's another discontented paper,</line>
            <line>Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,</line>
            <line>Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;</line>
            <line>But that belike Iago in the interim</line>
            <line>Came in and satisfied him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>O the pernicious caitiff!</line>

            <line>That was my wife's?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>I found it in my chamber:</line>
            <line>And he himself confess'd but even now</line>
            <line>That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose</line>
            <line>Which wrought to his desire.</line>

            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>There is besides in Roderigo's letter,</line>
            <line>How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</line>
            <line>Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came</line>
            <line>That I was cast: and even but now he spake,</line>
            <line>After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,</line>
            <line>Iago set him on.</line>

            <line>You must forsake this room, and go with us:</line>
            <line>Your power and your command is taken off,</line>
            <line>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</line>
            <line>If there be any cunning cruelty</line>
            <line>That can torment him much and hold him long,</line>
            <line>It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</line>
            <line>Till that the nature of your fault be known</line>
            <line>To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.</line>

            <line>Soft you; a word or two before you go.</line>
            <line>I have done the state some service, and they know't.</line>
            <line>No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</line>
            <line>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</line>
            <line>Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,</line>
            <line>Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak</line>
            <line>Of one that loved not wisely but too well;</line>
            <line>Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought</line>
            <line>Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,</line>
            <line>Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away</line>
            <line>Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,</line>
            <line>Albeit unused to the melting mood,</line>
            <line>Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees</line>
            <line>Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;</line>
            <line>And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</line>
            <line>Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk</line>
            <line>Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,</line>
            <line>I took by the throat the circumcised dog,</line>

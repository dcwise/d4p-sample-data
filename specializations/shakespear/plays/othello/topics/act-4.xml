         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!</line>
            <line>It is hypocrisy against the devil:</line>
            <line>They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,</line>
            <line>The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.</line>

            <line>Her honour is an essence that's not seen;</line>
            <line>They have it very oft that have it not:</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.</line>
            <line>Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,</line>

            <line>If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?</line>
            <line>Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,</line>
            <line>Who having, by their own importunate suit,</line>
            <line>Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,</line>
            <line>Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose</line>

            <line>He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,</line>

            <line>Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when</line>
            <line>they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.</line>
            <line>--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To</line>
            <line>confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be</line>
            <line>hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.</line>
            <line>Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing</line>
            <line>passion without some instruction. It is not words</line>
            <line>that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.</line>
            <line>--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--</line>

            <line>Work on,</line>
            <line>My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;</line>
            <line>And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,</line>
            <line>All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!</line>
            <line>My lord, I say! Othello!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:</line>
            <line>This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.</line>

            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>No, forbear;</line>
            <line>The lethargy must have his quiet course:</line>
            <line>If not, he foams at mouth and by and by</line>
            <line>Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:</line>
            <line>Do you withdraw yourself a little while,</line>
            <line>He will recover straight: when he is gone,</line>
            <line>I would on great occasion speak with you.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit CASSIO</stagedir>
            <line>How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?</line>

            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Dost thou mock me?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>There's many a beast then in a populous city,</line>

            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Did he confess it?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Good sir, be a man;</line>
            <line>Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked</line>
            <line>May draw with you: there's millions now alive</line>
            <line>That nightly lie in those unproper beds</line>
            <line>Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.</line>
            <line>O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,</line>
            <line>To lip a wanton in a secure couch,</line>
            <line>And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;</line>
            <line>And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Stand you awhile apart;</line>
            <line>Confine yourself but in a patient list.</line>
            <line>Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--</line>
            <line>A passion most unsuiting such a man--</line>
            <line>Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,</line>
            <line>And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,</line>
            <line>Bade him anon return and here speak with me;</line>
            <line>The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,</line>
            <line>And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,</line>
            <line>That dwell in every region of his face;</line>
            <line>For I will make him tell the tale anew,</line>
            <line>Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</line>
            <line>He hath, and is again to cope your wife:</line>
            <line>I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;</line>
            <line>Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,</line>
            <line>And nothing of a man.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Dost thou hear, Iago?</line>
            <line>I will be found most cunning in my patience;</line>
            <line>But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>That's not amiss;</line>
            <line>But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</line>
            <stagedir>OTHELLO retires</stagedir>
            <line>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</line>
            <line>A housewife that by selling her desires</line>
            <line>Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature</line>
            <line>That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague</line>
            <line>To beguile many and be beguiled by one:</line>
            <line>He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain</line>
            <line>From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:</line>
            <stagedir>Re-enter CASSIO</stagedir>
            <line>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;</line>
            <line>And his unbookish jealousy must construe</line>
            <line>Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,</line>
            <line>Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>The worser that you give me the addition</line>
            <line>Whose want even kills me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.</line>
            <stagedir>Speaking lower</stagedir>
            <line>Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,</line>
            <line>How quickly should you speed!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>Alas, poor caitiff!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Look, how he laughs already!</line>

         <speech>

            <line>I never knew woman love man so.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Do you hear, Cassio?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Now he importunes him</line>
            <line>To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>She gives it out that you shall marry hey:</line>
            <line>Do you intend it?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>Have you scored me? Well.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>This is the monkey's own giving out: she is</line>
            <line>persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and</line>
            <line>flattery, not out of my promise.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.</line>
            <line>I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with</line>
            <line>certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,</line>
            <line>and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture</line>
            <line>imports it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,</line>
            <line>and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,</line>
            <line>I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall</line>
            <line>throw it to.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
            <line>Well, I must leave her company.</line>

            <line>What do you mean by this haunting of me?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you</line>
            <line>mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?</line>
            <line>I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the</line>

            <line>Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,</line>
            <line>I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:</line>
            <line>If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,</line>
            <line>Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,</line>
            <line>Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,</line>
            <line>Delighted them in any other form;</line>
            <line>Or that I do not yet, and ever did.</line>
            <line>And ever will--though he do shake me off</line>
            <line>To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,</line>
            <line>Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;</line>
            <line>And his unkindness may defeat my life,</line>
            <line>But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'</line>
            <line>It does abhor me now I speak the word;</line>

            <line>Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from</line>
            <line>this instant to build on thee a better opinion than</line>
            <line>ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast</line>
            <line>taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I</line>
            <line>protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.</line>

            <line>Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I</line>

            <line>Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>

            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with</line>

            <line>lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;</line>
            <line>knocking out his brains.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.</line>
            <line>He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I</line>
            <line>go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable</line>
            <line>fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which</line>
            <line>I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,</line>
            <line>you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near</line>
            <line>to second your attempt, and he shall fall between</line>
            <line>us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with</line>
            <line>me; I will show you such a necessity in his death</line>
            <line>that you shall think yourself bound to put it on</line>
            <line>him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows</line>

         <speech>

            <line>The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.</line>
            <line>For a small vice.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>In troth, I think thou wouldst not.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
            <line>In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had</line>
            <line>done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a</line>
            <line>joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for</line>
            <line>gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty</line>
            <line>exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would</line>
            <line>not make her husband a cuckold to make him a</line>
            <line>monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
            <line>Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and</line>
            <line>having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your</line>
            <line>own world, and you might quickly make it right.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>I do not think there is any such woman.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
            <line>Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would</line>
            <line>store the world they played for.</line>
            <line>But I do think it is their husbands' faults</line>
            <line>If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,</line>
            <line>And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</line>
            <line>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</line>
            <line>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</line>
            <line>Or scant our former having in despite;</line>
            <line>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</line>
            <line>Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</line>
            <line>Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell</line>
            <line>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</line>
            <line>As husbands have. What is it that they do</line>
            <line>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</line>
            <line>I think it is: and doth affection breed it?</line>
            <line>I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?</line>
            <line>It is so too: and have not we affections,</line>
            <line>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</line>
            <line>Then let them use us well: else let them know,</line>
            <line>The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</line>

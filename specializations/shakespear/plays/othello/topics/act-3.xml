            <line>Why, no; the day had broke</line>
            <line>Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,</line>
            <line>To send in to your wife: my suit to her</line>
            <line>Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona</line>

            <line>The general and his wife are talking of it;</line>
            <line>And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,</line>
            <line>That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,</line>
            <line>And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom</line>
            <line>He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you</line>

            <line>Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;</line>
            <line>On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:</line>
            <line>I prithee, name the time, but let it not</line>
            <line>Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;</line>
            <line>And yet his trespass, in our common reason--</line>
            <line>Save that, they say, the wars must make examples</line>
            <line>Out of their best--is not almost a fault</line>
            <line>To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?</line>
            <line>Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,</line>
            <line>What you would ask me, that I should deny,</line>
            <line>Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,</line>
            <line>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,</line>
            <line>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</line>
            <line>Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do</line>
            <line>To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--</line>

         <speech>

            <line>Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
            <line>Why, this is not a boon;</line>
            <line>'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</line>
            <line>Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</line>
            <line>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</line>
            <line>To your own person: nay, when I have a suit</line>
            <line>Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</line>
            <line>It shall be full of poise and difficult weight</line>
            <line>And fearful to be granted.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>I will deny thee nothing:</line>
            <line>Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</line>

            <line>Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,</line>
            <line>But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,</line>
            <line>Chaos is come again.</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>What dost thou say, Iago?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,</line>
            <line>Know of your love?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>But for a satisfaction of my thought;</line>
            <line>No further harm.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Why of thy thought, Iago?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>O, yes; and went between us very oft.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Indeed!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?</line>
            <line>Is he not honest?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Honest, my lord!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Honest! ay, honest.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>My lord, for aught I know.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>What dost thou think?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Think, my lord!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Think, my lord!</line>
            <line>By heaven, he echoes me,</line>
            <line>As if there were some monster in his thought</line>
            <line>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:</line>
            <line>I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,</line>
            <line>When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?</line>
            <line>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</line>
            <line>In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'</line>
            <line>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</line>
            <line>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</line>
            <line>Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,</line>
            <line>Show me thy thought.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>My lord, you know I love you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>I think thou dost;</line>
            <line>And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,</line>
            <line>And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,</line>
            <line>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</line>
            <line>For such things in a false disloyal knave</line>
            <line>Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just</line>
            <line>They are close delations, working from the heart</line>
            <line>That passion cannot rule.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>For Michael Cassio,</line>
            <line>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>I think so too.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Men should be what they seem;</line>
            <line>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Certain, men should be what they seem.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Nay, yet there's more in this:</line>
            <line>I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,</line>
            <line>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</line>
            <line>The worst of words.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Good my lord, pardon me:</line>
            <line>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</line>
            <line>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</line>
            <line>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;</line>
            <line>As where's that palace whereinto foul things</line>
            <line>Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,</line>
            <line>But some uncleanly apprehensions</line>
            <line>Keep leets and law-days and in session sit</line>
            <line>With meditations lawful?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</line>
            <line>If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear</line>
            <line>A stranger to thy thoughts.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>I do beseech you--</line>
            <line>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,</line>
            <line>As, I confess, it is my nature's plague</line>
            <line>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</line>
            <line>Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,</line>
            <line>From one that so imperfectly conceits,</line>
            <line>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</line>
            <line>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</line>
            <line>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</line>
            <line>Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,</line>
            <line>To let you know my thoughts.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>What dost thou mean?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</line>
            <line>Is the immediate jewel of their souls:</line>
            <line>Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;</line>
            <line>'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:</line>
            <line>But he that filches from me my good name</line>
            <line>Robs me of that which not enriches him</line>
            <line>And makes me poor indeed.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;</line>
            <line>Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Ha!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;</line>
            <line>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock</line>
            <line>The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss</line>
            <line>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</line>
            <line>But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er</line>
            <line>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>O misery!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Poor and content is rich and rich enough,</line>
            <line>But riches fineless is as poor as winter</line>
            <line>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</line>
            <line>Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend</line>
            <line>From jealousy!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Why, why is this?</line>
            <line>Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,</line>
            <line>To follow still the changes of the moon</line>
            <line>With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt</line>
            <line>Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,</line>
            <line>When I shall turn the business of my soul</line>
            <line>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</line>
            <line>Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous</line>
            <line>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</line>
            <line>Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;</line>
            <line>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:</line>
            <line>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</line>
            <line>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;</line>
            <line>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;</line>
            <line>I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</line>
            <line>And on the proof, there is no more but this,--</line>
            <line>Away at once with love or jealousy!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason</line>
            <line>To show the love and duty that I bear you</line>
            <line>With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,</line>
            <line>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</line>
            <line>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</line>
            <line>Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:</line>
            <line>I would not have your free and noble nature,</line>
            <line>Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:</line>
            <line>I know our country disposition well;</line>
            <line>In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks</line>
            <line>They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</line>
            <line>Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Dost thou say so?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>She did deceive her father, marrying you;</line>
            <line>And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,</line>
            <line>She loved them most.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>And so she did.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Why, go to then;</line>
            <line>She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,</line>
            <line>To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-</line>
            <line>He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;</line>
            <line>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</line>
            <line>For too much loving you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>I am bound to thee for ever.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>Not a jot, not a jot.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>I' faith, I fear it has.</line>
            <line>I hope you will consider what is spoke</line>
            <line>Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:</line>
            <line>I am to pray you not to strain my speech</line>
            <line>To grosser issues nor to larger reach</line>
            <line>Than to suspicion.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>I will not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Should you do so, my lord,</line>
            <line>My speech should fall into such vile success</line>
            <line>As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--</line>
            <line>My lord, I see you're moved.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>No, not much moved:</line>
            <line>I do not think but Desdemona's honest.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Long live she so! and long live you to think so!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>And yet, how nature erring from itself,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--</line>
            <line>Not to affect many proposed matches</line>
            <line>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</line>
            <line>Whereto we see in all things nature tends--</line>
            <line>Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,</line>
            <line>Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.</line>
            <line>But pardon me; I do not in position</line>
            <line>Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear</line>
            <line>Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,</line>
            <line>May fall to match you with her country forms</line>
            <line>And happily repent.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>

            <line>To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:</line>
            <line>Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,</line>

            <line>Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,</line>
            <line>You shall by that perceive him and his means:</line>

            <line>With any strong or vehement importunity;</line>
            <line>Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,</line>

            <line>I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,</line>

            <line>Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--</line>
            <line>She's gone. I am abused; and my relief</line>

            <line>It were a tedious difficulty, I think,</line>

            <line>What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?</line>
            <line>It is impossible you should see this,</line>
            <line>Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,</line>
            <line>As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross</line>

            <line>If imputation and strong circumstances,</line>
            <line>Which lead directly to the door of truth,</line>
            <line>Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.</line>

            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>I do not like the office:</line>

            <line>Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,</line>
            <line>I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;</line>
            <line>And, being troubled with a raging tooth,</line>
            <line>I could not sleep.</line>
            <line>There are a kind of men so loose of soul,</line>
            <line>That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:</line>
            <line>One of this kind is Cassio:</line>
            <line>In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,</line>
            <line>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'</line>
            <line>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,</line>
            <line>Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,</line>
            <line>As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots</line>
            <line>That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg</line>
            <line>Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then</line>
            <line>Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>O monstrous! monstrous!</line>

            <line>Nay, this was but his dream.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
            <line>But this denoted a foregone conclusion:</line>
            <line>'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IAGO</speaker>
            <line>And this may help to thicken other proofs</line>

            <line>Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you</line>
            <line>That by your virtuous means I may again</line>
            <line>Exist, and be a member of his love</line>
            <line>Whom I with all the office of my heart</line>
            <line>Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.</line>
            <line>If my offence be of such mortal kind</line>
            <line>That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,</line>
            <line>Nor purposed merit in futurity,</line>
            <line>Can ransom me into his love again,</line>
            <line>But to know so must be my benefit;</line>
            <line>So shall I clothe me in a forced content,</line>
            <line>And shut myself up in some other course,</line>
            <line>To fortune's alms.</line>

            <line>Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!</line>
            <line>My advocation is not now in tune;</line>
            <line>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,</line>

            <line>So help me every spirit sanctified,</line>
            <line>As I have spoken for you all my best</line>

            <line>For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:</line>

            <line>And, like the devil, from his very arm</line>
            <line>Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?</line>
            <line>Something of moment then: I will go meet him:</line>

            <line>Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,</line>
            <line>Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;</line>

            <line>Our other healthful members even to that sense</line>

            <line>Nor of them look for such observances</line>
            <line>As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</line>
            <line>I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,</line>
            <line>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;</line>

            <line>Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.</line>

            <line>I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>GREMIO</speaker>
            <line>I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your</line>
            <line>wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am</line>
            <line>sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,</line>
            <line>that have been more kindly beholding to you than</line>
            <line>any, freely give unto you this young scholar,</line>
            <stagedir>Presenting LUCENTIO</stagedir>
            <line>that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning</line>

            <line>in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,</line>

            <line>Welcome, good Cambio.</line>
            <stagedir>To TRANIO</stagedir>
            <line>But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:</line>
            <line>may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TRANIO</speaker>
            <line>Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,</line>

            <line>Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,</line>
            <line>Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.</line>
            <line>Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,</line>
            <line>In the preferment of the eldest sister.</line>
            <line>This liberty is all that I request,</line>
            <line>That, upon knowledge of my parentage,</line>
            <line>I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo</line>
            <line>And free access and favour as the rest:</line>
            <line>And, toward the education of your daughters,</line>
            <line>I here bestow a simple instrument,</line>
            <line>And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:</line>
            <line>If you accept them, then their worth is great.</line>

            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>A mighty man of Pisa; by report</line>
            <line>I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,</line>
            <line>Take you the lute, and you the set of books;</line>
            <line>You shall go see your pupils presently.</line>
            <line>Holla, within!</line>
            <stagedir>Enter a Servant</stagedir>
            <line>Sirrah, lead these gentlemen</line>
            <line>To my daughters; and tell them both,</line>
            <line>These are their tutors: bid them use them well.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO,
BIONDELLO following</stagedir>
            <line>We will go walk a little in the orchard,</line>
            <line>And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,</line>
            <line>And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PETRUCHIO</speaker>
            <line>Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,</line>
            <line>And every day I cannot come to woo.</line>
            <line>You knew my father well, and in him me,</line>
            <line>Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,</line>
            <line>Which I have better'd rather than decreased:</line>
            <line>Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,</line>
            <line>What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>After my death the one half of my lands,</line>
            <line>And in possession twenty thousand crowns.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PETRUCHIO</speaker>
            <line>And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of</line>
            <line>Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,</line>
            <line>In all my lands and leases whatsoever:</line>
            <line>Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,</line>
            <line>That covenants may be kept on either hand.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,</line>
            <line>That is, her love; for that is all in all.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PETRUCHIO</speaker>
            <line>Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,</line>
            <line>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;</line>
            <line>And where two raging fires meet together</line>
            <line>They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:</line>
            <line>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</line>
            <line>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:</line>
            <line>So I to her and so she yields to me;</line>
            <line>For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!</line>
            <line>But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PETRUCHIO</speaker>
            <line>Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,</line>
            <line>That shake not, though they blow perpetually.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>I think she'll sooner prove a soldier</line>
            <line>Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.</line>
            <line>I did but tell her she mistook her frets,</line>
            <line>And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;</line>
            <line>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,</line>
            <line>'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume</line>
            <line>with them:'</line>
            <line>And, with that word, she struck me on the head,</line>
            <line>And through the instrument my pate made way;</line>
            <line>And there I stood amazed for a while,</line>
            <line>As on a pillory, looking through the lute;</line>
            <line>While she did call me rascal fiddler</line>
            <line>And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,</line>
            <line>As had she studied to misuse me so.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PETRUCHIO</speaker>
            <line>Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;</line>
            <line>I love her ten times more than e'er I did:</line>
            <line>O, how I long to have some chat with her!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:</line>
            <line>Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;</line>
            <line>She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.</line>
            <line>Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,</line>
            <line>Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PETRUCHIO</speaker>
            <line>I pray you do.</line>
            <stagedir>Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO</stagedir>
            <line>I will attend her here,</line>
            <line>And woo her with some spirit when she comes.</line>
            <line>Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain</line>
            <line>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:</line>
            <line>Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear</line>
            <line>As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:</line>
            <line>Say she be mute and will not speak a word;</line>
            <line>Then I'll commend her volubility,</line>
            <line>And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:</line>
            <line>If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,</line>
            <line>As though she bid me stay by her a week:</line>
            <line>If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day</line>
            <line>When I shall ask the banns and when be married.</line>

            <line>Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.</line>

            <line>Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GREMIO</speaker>
            <line>But thine doth fry.</line>
            <line>Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.</line>

            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:</line>
            <line>'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both</line>
            <line>That can assure my daughter greatest dower</line>
            <line>Shall have my Bianca's love.</line>
            <line>Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GREMIO</speaker>
            <line>First, as you know, my house within the city</line>
            <line>Is richly furnished with plate and gold;</line>
            <line>Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;</line>
            <line>My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;</line>
            <line>In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;</line>
            <line>In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,</line>
            <line>Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,</line>
            <line>Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,</line>
            <line>Valance of Venice gold in needlework,</line>
            <line>Pewter and brass and all things that belong</line>
            <line>To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm</line>
            <line>I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,</line>
            <line>Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,</line>
            <line>And all things answerable to this portion.</line>
            <line>Myself am struck in years, I must confess;</line>
            <line>And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,</line>
            <line>If whilst I live she will be only mine.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TRANIO</speaker>
            <line>That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:</line>
            <line>I am my father's heir and only son:</line>
            <line>If I may have your daughter to my wife,</line>
            <line>I'll leave her houses three or four as good,</line>
            <line>Within rich Pisa walls, as any one</line>
            <line>Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;</line>
            <line>Besides two thousand ducats by the year</line>
            <line>Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.</line>
            <line>What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GREMIO</speaker>
            <line>Two thousand ducats by the year of land!</line>
            <line>My land amounts not to so much in all:</line>
            <line>That she shall have; besides an argosy</line>
            <line>That now is lying in Marseilles' road.</line>
            <line>What, have I choked you with an argosy?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TRANIO</speaker>
            <line>Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less</line>
            <line>Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,</line>
            <line>And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,</line>
            <line>And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GREMIO</speaker>
            <line>Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;</line>
            <line>And she can have no more than all I have:</line>
            <line>If you like me, she shall have me and mine.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TRANIO</speaker>
            <line>Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,</line>
            <line>By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>I must confess your offer is the best;</line>
            <line>And, let your father make her the assurance,</line>
            <line>She is your own; else, you must pardon me,</line>
            <line>if you should die before him, where's her dower?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>TRANIO</speaker>
            <line>That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GREMIO</speaker>
            <line>And may not young men die, as well as old?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BAPTISTA</speaker>
            <line>Well, gentlemen,</line>
            <line>I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know</line>
            <line>My daughter Katharina is to be married:</line>
            <line>Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca</line>
            <line>Be bride to you, if you this assurance;</line>
            <line>If not, Signior Gremio:</line>
            <line>And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GREMIO</speaker>
            <line>Adieu, good neighbour.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit BAPTISTA</stagedir>
            <line>Now I fear thee not:</line>
            <line>Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool</line>
            <line>To give thee all, and in his waning age</line>
            <line>Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!</line>
            <line>An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>TRANIO</speaker>
            <line>A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!</line>
            <line>Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.</line>
            <line>'Tis in my head to do my master good:</line>
            <line>I see no reason but supposed Lucentio</line>
            <line>Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'</line>
            <line>And that's a wonder: fathers commonly</line>
            <line>Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,</line>
            <line>A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.</line>

            <line>Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:</line>
            <line>Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;</line>
            <line>And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.</line>

            <line>He cried upon it at the merest loss</line>
            <line>And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:</line>
            <line>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord</speaker>
            <line>Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,</line>
            <line>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</line>
            <line>But sup them well and look unto them all:</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Huntsman</speaker>
            <line>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,</line>

            <line>O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!</line>
            <line>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</line>
            <line>Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.</line>
            <line>What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,</line>
            <line>Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</line>
            <line>A most delicious banquet by his bed,</line>
            <line>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</line>
            <line>Would not the beggar then forget himself?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Huntsman</speaker>
            <line>It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord</speaker>
            <line>Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.</line>
            <line>Then take him up and manage well the jest:</line>
            <line>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber</line>
            <line>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:</line>
            <line>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters</line>
            <line>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:</line>
            <line>Procure me music ready when he wakes,</line>
            <line>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</line>
            <line>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight</line>
            <line>And with a low submissive reverence</line>
            <line>Say 'What is it your honour will command?'</line>
            <line>Let one attend him with a silver basin</line>
            <line>Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,</line>
            <line>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</line>
            <line>And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'</line>
            <line>Some one be ready with a costly suit</line>
            <line>And ask him what apparel he will wear;</line>
            <line>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</line>
            <line>And that his lady mourns at his disease:</line>
            <line>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;</line>
            <line>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</line>
            <line>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</line>
            <line>This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:</line>
            <line>It will be pastime passing excellent,</line>
            <line>If it be husbanded with modesty.</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>First Huntsman</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,</line>
            <line>As he shall think by our true diligence</line>
            <line>He is no less than what we say he is.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord</speaker>
            <line>Take him up gently and to bed with him;</line>
            <line>And each one to his office when he wakes.</line>
            <stagedir>Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds</stagedir>

            <speaker>Lord</speaker>
            <line>With all my heart. This fellow I remember,</line>
            <line>Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:</line>
            <line>'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:</line>
            <line>I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part</line>
            <line>Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>A Player</speaker>
            <line>I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Lord</speaker>
            <line>'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.</line>
            <line>Well, you are come to me in a happy time;</line>
            <line>The rather for I have some sport in hand</line>
            <line>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</line>
            <line>There is a lord will hear you play to-night:</line>
            <line>But I am doubtful of your modesties;</line>
            <line>Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--</line>
            <line>For yet his honour never heard a play--</line>
            <line>You break into some merry passion</line>
            <line>And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</line>
            <line>If you should smile he grows impatient.</line>

            <speaker>A Player</speaker>
            <line>Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,</line>

            <speaker>Lord</speaker>
            <line>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,</line>
            <line>And give them friendly welcome every one:</line>
            <line>Let them want nothing that my house affords.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit one with the Players</stagedir>
            <line>Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,</line>
            <line>And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:</line>
            <line>That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;</line>
            <line>And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.</line>
            <line>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</line>
            <line>He bear himself with honourable action,</line>
            <line>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</line>
            <line>Unto their lords, by them accomplished:</line>
            <line>Such duty to the drunkard let him do</line>
            <line>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</line>
            <line>And say 'What is't your honour will command,</line>
            <line>Wherein your lady and your humble wife</line>
            <line>May show her duty and make known her love?'</line>
            <line>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</line>
            <line>And with declining head into his bosom,</line>
            <line>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd</line>
            <line>To see her noble lord restored to health,</line>
            <line>Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him</line>
            <line>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:</line>
            <line>And if the boy have not a woman's gift</line>
            <line>To rain a shower of commanded tears,</line>
            <line>An onion will do well for such a shift,</line>
            <line>Which in a napkin being close convey'd</line>
            <line>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</line>
            <line>See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:</line>
            <line>Anon I'll give thee more instructions.</line>
            <stagedir>Exit a Servingman</stagedir>
            <line>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</line>
            <line>Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:</line>
            <line>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</line>
            <line>And how my men will stay themselves from laughter</line>
            <line>When they do homage to this simple peasant.</line>
            <line>I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence</line>
            <line>May well abate the over-merry spleen</line>

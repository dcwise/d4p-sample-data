            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:</line>
            <line>Have you so soon forgot the entertainment</line>
            <line>Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>But, wrangling pedant, this is</line>
            <line>The patroness of heavenly harmony:</line>
            <line>Then give me leave to have prerogative;</line>
            <line>And when in music we have spent an hour,</line>
            <line>Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Preposterous ass, that never read so far</line>
            <line>To know the cause why music was ordain'd!</line>
            <line>Was it not to refresh the mind of man</line>
            <line>After his studies or his usual pain?</line>
            <line>Then give me leave to read philosophy,</line>
            <line>And while I pause, serve in your harmony.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,</line>
            <line>To strive for that which resteth in my choice:</line>
            <line>I am no breeching scholar in the schools;</line>
            <line>I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,</line>
            <line>But learn my lessons as I please myself.</line>
            <line>And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:</line>
            <line>Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;</line>
            <line>His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>That will be never: tune your instrument.</line>

            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>Where left we last?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Here, madam:</line>
            <line>'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;</line>
            <line>Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>Construe them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am</line>
            <line>Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,</line>
            <line>'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;</line>
            <line>'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes</line>
            <line>a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'</line>
            <line>bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might</line>
            <line>beguile the old pantaloon.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>Madam, my instrument's in tune.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat</line>
            <line>Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I</line>
            <line>trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed</line>
            <line>he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'</line>
            <line>despair not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>Madam, 'tis now in tune.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>All but the base.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.</line>
            <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>
            <line>How fiery and forward our pedant is!</line>
            <line>Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:</line>
            <line>Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides</line>
            <line>Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>I must believe my master; else, I promise you,</line>
            <line>I should be arguing still upon that doubt:</line>
            <line>But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:</line>
            <line>Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,</line>
            <line>That I have been thus pleasant with you both.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>You may go walk, and give me leave a while:</line>
            <line>My lessons make no music in three parts.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,</line>
            <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>
            <line>And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,</line>
            <line>Our fine musician groweth amorous.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>Madam, before you touch the instrument,</line>
            <line>To learn the order of my fingering,</line>
            <line>I must begin with rudiments of art;</line>
            <line>To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,</line>
            <line>More pleasant, pithy and effectual,</line>
            <line>Than hath been taught by any of my trade:</line>
            <line>And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
            <line>Why, I am past my gamut long ago.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.</line>

            <line>'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,</line>
            <line>'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:</line>
            <line>'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:</line>
            <line>'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'</line>
            <line>Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:</line>
            <line>Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,</line>
            <line>To change true rules for old inventions.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter a Servant</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Servant</speaker>
            <line>Mistress, your father prays you leave your books</line>
            <line>And help to dress your sister's chamber up:</line>
            <line>You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.</line>

            <line>Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.</line>

         <stagedir>Exeunt BIANCA and Servant</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LUCENTIO</speaker>
            <line>Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.</line>

         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORTENSIO</speaker>
            <line>But I have cause to pry into this pedant:</line>
            <line>Methinks he looks as though he were in love:</line>
            <line>Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble</line>
            <line>To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,</line>
            <line>Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,</line>
            <line>Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.</line>

            <line>That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,</line>
            <line>And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.</line>
            <line>What will be said? what mockery will it be,</line>
            <line>To want the bridegroom when the priest attends</line>
            <line>To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!</line>
            <line>What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?</line>

            <line>No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced</line>

            <line>Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;</line>
            <line>Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.</line>
            <line>I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,</line>
            <line>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:</line>

            <line>Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;</line>
            <line>Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.</line>
            <line>Now must the world point at poor Katharina,</line>

            <line>Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old</line>
            <line>jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair</line>
            <line>of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,</line>
            <line>another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the</line>
            <line>town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;</line>
            <line>with two broken points: his horse hipped with an</line>
            <line>old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;</line>
            <line>besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose</line>
            <line>in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected</line>
            <line>with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with</line>
            <line>spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,</line>
            <line>stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the</line>
            <line>bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;</line>
            <line>near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit</line>
            <line>and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being</line>
            <line>restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been</line>
            <line>often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth</line>
            <line>six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,</line>
            <line>which hath two letters for her name fairly set down</line>

            <line>O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned</line>
            <line>like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a</line>
            <line>kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red</line>
            <line>and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty</line>
            <line>fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a</line>
            <line>very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian</line>
            <line>footboy or a gentleman's lackey.</line>

            <speaker>TRANIO</speaker>
            <line>'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;</line>

            <line>I would your duty were as foolish too:</line>
            <line>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</line>
            <line>Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.</line>

            <speaker>KATHARINA</speaker>
            <line>Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</line>
            <line>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</line>
            <line>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:</line>
            <line>It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,</line>
            <line>Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</line>
            <line>And in no sense is meet or amiable.</line>
            <line>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</line>
            <line>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</line>
            <line>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</line>
            <line>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</line>
            <line>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</line>
            <line>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</line>
            <line>And for thy maintenance commits his body</line>
            <line>To painful labour both by sea and land,</line>
            <line>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</line>
            <line>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</line>
            <line>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</line>
            <line>But love, fair looks and true obedience;</line>
            <line>Too little payment for so great a debt.</line>
            <line>Such duty as the subject owes the prince</line>
            <line>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</line>
            <line>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</line>
            <line>And not obedient to his honest will,</line>
            <line>What is she but a foul contending rebel</line>
            <line>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</line>
            <line>I am ashamed that women are so simple</line>
            <line>To offer war where they should kneel for peace;</line>
            <line>Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,</line>
            <line>When they are bound to serve, love and obey.</line>
            <line>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</line>
            <line>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</line>
            <line>But that our soft conditions and our hearts</line>
            <line>Should well agree with our external parts?</line>
            <line>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</line>
            <line>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</line>
            <line>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</line>
            <line>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</line>
            <line>But now I see our lances are but straws,</line>
            <line>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</line>
            <line>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</line>
            <line>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</line>
            <line>And place your hands below your husband's foot:</line>
            <line>In token of which duty, if he please,</line>
            <line>My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</line>

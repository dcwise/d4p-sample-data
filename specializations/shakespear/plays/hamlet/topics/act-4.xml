            <line>Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend</line>

            <line>Behind the arras hearing something stir,</line>
            <line>Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'</line>

            <line>It had been so with us, had we been there:</line>
            <line>His liberty is full of threats to all;</line>
            <line>To you yourself, to us, to every one.</line>
            <line>Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?</line>

            <line>Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple</line>
            <line>Of thinking too precisely on the event,</line>
            <line>A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom</line>

            <line>Led by a delicate and tender prince,</line>
            <line>Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd</line>
            <line>Makes mouths at the invisible event,</line>
            <line>Exposing what is mortal and unsure</line>
            <line>To all that fortune, death and danger dare,</line>
            <line>Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great</line>
            <line>Is not to stir without great argument,</line>
            <line>But greatly to find quarrel in a straw</line>
            <line>When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,</line>
            <line>That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,</line>
            <line>Excitements of my reason and my blood,</line>
            <line>And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see</line>
            <line>The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</line>
            <line>That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,</line>
            <line>Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot</line>

            <line>I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;</line>
            <line>It warms the very sickness in my heart,</line>

            <line>Will you be ruled by me?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,</line>
            <line>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</line>
            <line>No more to undertake it, I will work him</line>
            <line>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</line>
            <line>Under the which he shall not choose but fall:</line>
            <line>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</line>
            <line>But even his mother shall uncharge the practise</line>

            <line>It falls right.</line>
            <line>You have been talk'd of since your travel much,</line>
            <line>And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality</line>
            <line>Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts</line>
            <line>Did not together pluck such envy from him</line>
            <line>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</line>
            <line>Of the unworthiest siege.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>A very riband in the cap of youth,</line>
            <line>Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</line>
            <line>The light and careless livery that it wears</line>
            <line>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</line>
            <line>Importing health and graveness. Two months since,</line>
            <line>Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--</line>
            <line>I've seen myself, and served against, the French,</line>
            <line>And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</line>
            <line>Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;</line>
            <line>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</line>
            <line>As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</line>
            <line>With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,</line>
            <line>That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</line>
            <line>Come short of what he did.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>He made confession of you,</line>
            <line>And gave you such a masterly report</line>
            <line>For art and exercise in your defence</line>
            <line>And for your rapier most especially,</line>
            <line>That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,</line>
            <line>If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,</line>
            <line>He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</line>
            <line>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</line>
            <line>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</line>
            <line>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</line>
            <line>Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.</line>
            <line>Now, out of this,--</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LAERTES</speaker>
            <line>What out of this, my lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</line>
            <line>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</line>
            <line>A face without a heart?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LAERTES</speaker>
            <line>Why ask you this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>Not that I think you did not love your father;</line>
            <line>But that I know love is begun by time;</line>
            <line>And that I see, in passages of proof,</line>
            <line>Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</line>
            <line>There lives within the very flame of love</line>
            <line>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</line>
            <line>And nothing is at a like goodness still;</line>
            <line>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</line>
            <line>Dies in his own too much: that we would do</line>
            <line>We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes</line>
            <line>And hath abatements and delays as many</line>
            <line>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</line>
            <line>And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,</line>
            <line>That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--</line>
            <line>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,</line>
            <line>To show yourself your father's son in deed</line>
            <line>More than in words?</line>
         </speech>

            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</line>
            <line>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</line>
            <line>Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</line>
            <line>Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:</line>
            <line>We'll put on those shall praise your excellence</line>
            <line>And set a double varnish on the fame</line>
            <line>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together</line>
            <line>And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,</line>
            <line>Most generous and free from all contriving,</line>
            <line>Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,</line>
            <line>Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</line>
            <line>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise</line>
            <line>Requite him for your father.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LAERTES</speaker>
            <line>I will do't:</line>
            <line>And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.</line>
            <line>I bought an unction of a mountebank,</line>
            <line>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</line>
            <line>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</line>
            <line>Collected from all simples that have virtue</line>
            <line>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</line>
            <line>That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point</line>
            <line>With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,</line>
            <line>It may be death.</line>

            <line>Let's further think of this;</line>
            <line>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</line>
            <line>May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,</line>
            <line>And that our drift look through our bad performance,</line>
            <line>'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project</line>
            <line>Should have a back or second, that might hold,</line>

            <line>We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.</line>
            <line>When in your motion you are hot and dry--</line>

            <line>And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him</line>
            <line>A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,</line>
            <line>If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,</line>

            <line>There with fantastic garlands did she come</line>
            <line>Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples</line>
            <line>That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,</line>
            <line>But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:</line>
            <line>There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds</line>
            <line>Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;</line>
            <line>When down her weedy trophies and herself</line>
            <line>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;</line>
            <line>And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:</line>
            <line>Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;</line>
            <line>As one incapable of her own distress,</line>
            <line>Or like a creature native and indued</line>
            <line>Unto that element: but long it could not be</line>
            <line>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</line>

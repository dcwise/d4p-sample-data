         <stagedir>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS,

            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>And can you, by no drift of circumstance,</line>
            <line>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</line>
            <line>Grating so harshly all his days of quiet</line>
            <line>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSENCRANTZ</speaker>
            <line>He does confess he feels himself distracted;</line>
            <line>But from what cause he will by no means speak.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GUILDENSTERN</speaker>
            <line>Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</line>
            <line>But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,</line>
            <line>When we would bring him on to some confession</line>
            <line>Of his true state.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN GERTRUDE</speaker>
            <line>Did he receive you well?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSENCRANTZ</speaker>
            <line>Most like a gentleman.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>GUILDENSTERN</speaker>
            <line>But with much forcing of his disposition.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSENCRANTZ</speaker>
            <line>Niggard of question; but, of our demands,</line>
            <line>Most free in his reply.</line>

            <speaker>QUEEN GERTRUDE</speaker>
            <line>Did you assay him?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>ROSENCRANTZ</speaker>
            <line>Madam, it so fell out, that certain players</line>
            <line>We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;</line>
            <line>And there did seem in him a kind of joy</line>
            <line>To hear of it: they are about the court,</line>
            <line>And, as I think, they have already order</line>
            <line>This night to play before him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>'Tis most true:</line>
            <line>And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties</line>
            <line>To hear and see the matter.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>With all my heart; and it doth much content me</line>
            <line>To hear him so inclined.</line>
            <line>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,</line>
            <line>And drive his purpose on to these delights.</line>

            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;</line>
            <line>For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,</line>
            <line>That he, as 'twere by accident, may here</line>
            <line>Affront Ophelia:</line>
            <line>Her father and myself, lawful espials,</line>
            <line>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,</line>
            <line>We may of their encounter frankly judge,</line>
            <line>And gather by him, as he is behaved,</line>
            <line>If 't be the affliction of his love or no</line>
            <line>That thus he suffers for.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN GERTRUDE</speaker>
            <line>I shall obey you.</line>
            <line>And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</line>
            <line>That your good beauties be the happy cause</line>
            <line>Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues</line>
            <line>Will bring him to his wonted way again,</line>
            <line>To both your honours.</line>

            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,</line>
            <line>We will bestow ourselves.</line>
            <stagedir>To OPHELIA</stagedir>
            <line>Read on this book;</line>
            <line>That show of such an exercise may colour</line>
            <line>Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--</line>
            <line>'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage</line>
            <line>And pious action we do sugar o'er</line>
            <line>The devil himself.</line>

               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>          O, 'tis too true!</line>
            <line>How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!</line>
            <line>The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,</line>
            <line>Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it</line>
            <line>Than is my deed to my most painted word:</line>
            <line>O heavy burthen!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS</stagedir>
         <stagedir>Enter HAMLET</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</line>
            <line>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</line>
            <line>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</line>
            <line>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</line>
            <line>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</line>
            <line>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</line>
            <line>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</line>
            <line>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation</line>
            <line>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</line>
            <line>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;</line>
            <line>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</line>
            <line>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</line>
            <line>Must give us pause: there's the respect</line>
            <line>That makes calamity of so long life;</line>
            <line>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</line>
            <line>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</line>
            <line>The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,</line>
            <line>The insolence of office and the spurns</line>
            <line>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</line>
            <line>When he himself might his quietus make</line>
            <line>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</line>
            <line>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</line>
            <line>But that the dread of something after death,</line>
            <line>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn</line>
            <line>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</line>
            <line>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</line>
            <line>Than fly to others that we know not of?</line>
            <line>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</line>
            <line>And thus the native hue of resolution</line>
            <line>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</line>
            <line>And enterprises of great pith and moment</line>
            <line>With this regard their currents turn awry,</line>
            <line>And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!</line>
            <line>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</line>
            <line>Be all my sins remember'd.</line>

            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>Good my lord,</line>
            <line>How does your honour for this many a day?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I have remembrances of yours,</line>
            <line>That I have longed long to re-deliver;</line>
            <line>I pray you, now receive them.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>No, not I;</line>
            <line>I never gave you aught.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;</line>
            <line>And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed</line>
            <line>As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,</line>
            <line>Take these again; for to the noble mind</line>
            <line>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</line>
            <line>There, my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>Ha, ha! are you honest?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>My lord?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>Are you fair?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>What means your lordship?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should</line>
            <line>admit no discourse to your beauty.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than</line>
            <line>with honesty?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner</line>
            <line>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the</line>
            <line>force of honesty can translate beauty into his</line>
            <line>likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the</line>
            <line>time gives it proof. I did love you once.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot</line>
            <line>so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of</line>
            <line>it: I loved you not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>I was the more deceived.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a</line>
            <line>breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;</line>
            <line>but yet I could accuse me of such things that it</line>
            <line>were better my mother had not borne me: I am very</line>
            <line>proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at</line>
            <line>my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,</line>
            <line>imagination to give them shape, or time to act them</line>
            <line>in. What should such fellows as I do crawling</line>
            <line>between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,</line>
            <line>all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.</line>

            <line>If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for</line>
            <line>thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as</line>
            <line>snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a</line>
            <line>nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs</line>
            <line>marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough</line>
            <line>what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,</line>

            <line>I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God</line>

            <line>nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness</line>
            <line>your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath</line>
            <line>made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:</line>
            <line>those that are married already, all but one, shall</line>

            <line>Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,</line>

            <line>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to</line>
            <line>you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,</line>
            <line>as many of your players do, I had as lief the</line>
            <line>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air</line>
            <line>too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;</line>
            <line>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,</line>
            <line>the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget</line>
            <line>a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it</line>

            <line>periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to</line>
            <line>very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who</line>
            <line>for the most part are capable of nothing but</line>
            <line>inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such</line>

            <line>Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;</line>

            <line>What to ourselves in passion we propose,</line>
            <line>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.</line>
            <line>The violence of either grief or joy</line>

            <line>This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange</line>
            <line>That even our loves should with our fortunes change;</line>
            <line>For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,</line>

            <line>The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;</line>
            <line>The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.</line>

            <line>It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,</line>
            <line>A brother's murder. Pray can I not,</line>

            <line>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</line>

            <line>Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;</line>

            <line>Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?</line>
            <line>That cannot be; since I am still possess'd</line>

            <line>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</line>
            <line>See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</line>
            <line>Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;</line>
            <line>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</line>
            <line>A station like the herald Mercury</line>
            <line>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</line>
            <line>A combination and a form indeed,</line>
            <line>Where every god did seem to set his seal,</line>
            <line>To give the world assurance of a man:</line>
            <line>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:</line>
            <line>Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,</line>
            <line>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</line>
            <line>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</line>
            <line>And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?</line>
            <line>You cannot call it love; for at your age</line>
            <line>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,</line>
            <line>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</line>
            <line>Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,</line>
            <line>Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</line>
            <line>Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,</line>
            <line>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd</line>
            <line>But it reserved some quantity of choice,</line>
            <line>To serve in such a difference. What devil was't</line>
            <line>That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?</line>
            <line>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</line>
            <line>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</line>
            <line>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</line>
            <line>Could not so mope.</line>
            <line>O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</line>
            <line>If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,</line>
            <line>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,</line>
            <line>And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame</line>
            <line>When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,</line>
            <line>Since frost itself as actively doth burn</line>

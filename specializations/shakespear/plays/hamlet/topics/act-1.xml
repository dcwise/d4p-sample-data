            <line>Say,</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>A piece of him.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>I have seen nothing.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,</line>
            <line>And will not let belief take hold of him</line>
            <line>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:</line>
            <line>Therefore I have entreated him along</line>
            <line>With us to watch the minutes of this night;</line>
            <line>That if again this apparition come,</line>
            <line>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>Sit down awhile;</line>
            <line>And let us once again assail your ears,</line>
            <line>That are so fortified against our story</line>
            <line>What we have two nights seen.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Well, sit we down,</line>
            <line>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>Last night of all,</line>
            <line>When yond same star that's westward from the pole</line>
            <line>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</line>
            <line>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</line>
            <line>The bell then beating one,--</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Enter Ghost</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>It would be spoke to.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>Question it, Horatio.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,</line>
            <line>Together with that fair and warlike form</line>
            <line>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</line>
            <line>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>It is offended.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>See, it stalks away!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit Ghost</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>'Tis gone, and will not answer.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</line>
            <line>Is not this something more than fantasy?</line>
            <line>What think you on't?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Before my God, I might not this believe</line>
            <line>Without the sensible and true avouch</line>
            <line>Of mine own eyes.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>Is it not like the king?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>As thou art to thyself:</line>
            <line>Such was the very armour he had on</line>
            <line>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</line>
            <line>So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,</line>
            <line>He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</line>
            <line>'Tis strange.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</line>
            <line>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>In what particular thought to work I know not;</line>
            <line>But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</line>
            <line>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</line>
            <line>Why this same strict and most observant watch</line>
            <line>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</line>
            <line>And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</line>
            <line>And foreign mart for implements of war;</line>
            <line>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</line>
            <line>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</line>
            <line>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</line>
            <line>Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</line>
            <line>Who is't that can inform me?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>That can I;</line>
            <line>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</line>
            <line>Whose image even but now appear'd to us,</line>
            <line>Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</line>
            <line>Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,</line>
            <line>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--</line>
            <line>For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--</line>
            <line>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,</line>
            <line>Well ratified by law and heraldry,</line>
            <line>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</line>
            <line>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</line>
            <line>Against the which, a moiety competent</line>
            <line>Was gaged by our king; which had return'd</line>
            <line>To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</line>
            <line>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</line>
            <line>And carriage of the article design'd,</line>
            <line>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</line>
            <line>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</line>
            <line>Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</line>
            <line>Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,</line>
            <line>For food and diet, to some enterprise</line>
            <line>That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--</line>
            <line>As it doth well appear unto our state--</line>
            <line>But to recover of us, by strong hand</line>
            <line>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</line>
            <line>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</line>
            <line>Is the main motive of our preparations,</line>
            <line>The source of this our watch and the chief head</line>
            <line>Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>I think it be no other but e'en so:</line>
            <line>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</line>
            <line>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</line>
            <line>That was and is the question of these wars.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.</line>
            <line>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</line>
            <line>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</line>
            <line>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</line>
            <line>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</line>
            <line>As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</line>
            <line>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</line>
            <line>Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands</line>
            <line>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</line>
            <line>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</line>
            <line>As harbingers preceding still the fates</line>
            <line>And prologue to the omen coming on,</line>
            <line>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</line>
            <line>Unto our climatures and countrymen.--</line>
            <line>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</line>
            <stagedir>Re-enter Ghost</stagedir>
            <line>I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</line>
            <line>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</line>
            <line>Speak to me:</line>
            <line>If there be any good thing to be done,</line>
            <line>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</line>
            <line>Speak to me:</line>
            <stagedir>Cock crows</stagedir>
            <line>If thou art privy to thy country's fate,</line>
            <line>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</line>
            <line>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</line>
            <line>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</line>
            <line>For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</line>
            <line>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Do, if it will not stand.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>'Tis here!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>'Tis here!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>'Tis gone!</line>
            <stagedir>Exit Ghost</stagedir>
            <line>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</line>
            <line>To offer it the show of violence;</line>
            <line>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</line>
            <line>And our vain blows malicious mockery.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>BERNARDO</speaker>
            <line>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>And then it started like a guilty thing</line>
            <line>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</line>
            <line>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</line>
            <line>Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</line>
            <line>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</line>
            <line>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</line>
            <line>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</line>
            <line>To his confine: and of the truth herein</line>
            <line>This present object made probation.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</line>
            <line>Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes</line>
            <line>Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</line>
            <line>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</line>
            <line>And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</line>
            <line>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</line>
            <line>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</line>
            <line>So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</line>
            <line>But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</line>
            <line>Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</line>
            <line>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</line>
            <line>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</line>

            <line>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death</line>
            <line>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</line>
            <line>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</line>
            <line>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</line>

            <line>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</line>
            <line>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</line>
            <line>In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--</line>
            <line>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd</line>
            <line>Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</line>
            <line>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</line>

            <line>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</line>

            <line>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</line>

            <line>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</line>
            <line>To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</line>
            <line>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</line>
            <line>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</line>

            <line>The lists and full proportions, are all made</line>
            <line>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</line>

            <line>Giving to you no further personal power</line>

            <line>The head is not more native to the heart,</line>

            <line>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</line>
            <line>Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,</line>
            <line>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</line>
            <line>That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,</line>

            <speaker>KING CLAUDIUS</speaker>
            <line>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</line>
            <line>To give these mourning duties to your father:</line>
            <line>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</line>
            <line>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</line>
            <line>In filial obligation for some term</line>
            <line>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</line>
            <line>In obstinate condolement is a course</line>
            <line>Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;</line>
            <line>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</line>
            <line>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</line>
            <line>An understanding simple and unschool'd:</line>
            <line>For what we know must be and is as common</line>
            <line>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</line>
            <line>Why should we in our peevish opposition</line>
            <line>Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,</line>
            <line>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</line>
            <line>To reason most absurd: whose common theme</line>
            <line>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</line>
            <line>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</line>
            <line>'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth</line>
            <line>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</line>
            <line>As of a father: for let the world take note,</line>
            <line>You are the most immediate to our throne;</line>
            <line>And with no less nobility of love</line>
            <line>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</line>
            <line>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</line>
            <line>In going back to school in Wittenberg,</line>
            <line>It is most retrograde to our desire:</line>
            <line>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</line>
            <line>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</line>

            <line>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</line>
            <line>This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</line>
            <line>Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,</line>
            <line>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,</line>
            <line>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</line>
            <line>And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,</line>

            <line>Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,</line>

            <line>But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:</line>
            <line>So excellent a king; that was, to this,</line>
            <line>Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother</line>
            <line>That he might not beteem the winds of heaven</line>
            <line>Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!</line>

            <line>A little month, or ere those shoes were old</line>
            <line>With which she follow'd my poor father's body,</line>

            <line>O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,</line>
            <line>Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,</line>
            <line>My father's brother, but no more like my father</line>
            <line>Than I to Hercules: within a month:</line>
            <line>Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears</line>
            <line>Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,</line>
            <line>She married. O, most wicked speed, to post</line>

            <line>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</line>
            <line>Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,</line>
            <line>In the dead vast and middle of the night,</line>
            <line>Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,</line>
            <line>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</line>
            <line>Appears before them, and with solemn march</line>
            <line>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd</line>
            <line>By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,</line>
            <line>Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled</line>
            <line>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</line>
            <line>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</line>
            <line>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</line>
            <line>And I with them the third night kept the watch;</line>
            <line>Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,</line>
            <line>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</line>
            <line>The apparition comes: I knew your father;</line>
            <line>These hands are not more like.</line>

            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>MARCELLUS</speaker>
            <line>My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>

            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I did;</line>
            <line>But answer made it none: yet once methought</line>
            <line>It lifted up its head and did address</line>
            <line>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</line>
            <line>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</line>
            <line>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</line>
            <line>And vanish'd from our sight.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>

            <line>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</line>
            <line>The inward service of the mind and soul</line>
            <line>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</line>
            <line>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</line>
            <line>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</line>
            <line>His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</line>
            <line>For he himself is subject to his birth:</line>
            <line>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</line>

            <line>The safety and health of this whole state;</line>

            <line>Unto the voice and yielding of that body</line>
            <line>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</line>
            <line>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</line>
            <line>As he in his particular act and place</line>
            <line>May give his saying deed; which is no further</line>
            <line>Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</line>
            <line>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</line>
            <line>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</line>
            <line>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</line>
            <line>To his unmaster'd importunity.</line>
            <line>Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</line>
            <line>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</line>

            <line>The canker galls the infants of the spring,</line>

            <line>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</line>
            <line>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</line>

            <line>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</line>
            <line>Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</line>
            <line>Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;</line>
            <line>But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</line>

            <line>Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,</line>
            <line>When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</line>
            <line>Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,</line>
            <line>Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,</line>
            <line>Even in their promise, as it is a-making,</line>
            <line>You must not take for fire. From this time</line>
            <line>Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;</line>
            <line>Set your entreatments at a higher rate</line>
            <line>Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,</line>
            <line>Believe so much in him, that he is young</line>
            <line>And with a larger tether may he walk</line>
            <line>Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</line>
            <line>Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,</line>
            <line>Not of that dye which their investments show,</line>
            <line>But mere implorators of unholy suits,</line>
            <line>Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,</line>
            <line>The better to beguile. This is for all:</line>
            <line>I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,</line>
            <line>Have you so slander any moment leisure,</line>
            <line>As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.</line>

            <line>This heavy-headed revel east and west</line>
            <line>Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:</line>

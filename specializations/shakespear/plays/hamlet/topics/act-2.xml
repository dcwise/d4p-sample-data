            <line>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</line>
            <line>Before you visit him, to make inquire</line>

            <line>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</line>
            <line>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</line>
            <line>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</line>
            <line>What company, at what expense; and finding</line>
            <line>By this encompassment and drift of question</line>
            <line>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</line>
            <line>Than your particular demands will touch it:</line>
            <line>Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</line>
            <line>As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</line>
            <line>And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>

            <line>Ay, very well, my lord.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</line>
            <line>But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</line>
            <line>Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</line>
            <line>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</line>
            <line>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</line>
            <line>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</line>
            <line>As are companions noted and most known</line>
            <line>To youth and liberty.</line>
         </speech>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</line>
            <line>Drabbing: you may go so far.</line>

            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</line>
            <line>You must not put another scandal on him,</line>
            <line>That he is open to incontinency;</line>
            <line>That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</line>
            <line>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</line>
            <line>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</line>
            <line>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</line>
            <line>Of general assault.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>Wherefore should you do this?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>REYNALDO</speaker>
            <line>Ay, my lord,</line>
            <line>I would know that.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>Marry, sir, here's my drift;</line>
            <line>And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</line>
            <line>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</line>
            <line>As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</line>
            <line>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</line>
            <line>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</line>
            <line>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</line>
            <line>He closes with you in this consequence;</line>
            <line>'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</line>
            <line>According to the phrase or the addition</line>
            <line>Of man and country.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>REYNALDO</speaker>
            <line>Very good, my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I</line>
            <line>about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</line>
            <line>something: where did I leave?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>REYNALDO</speaker>
            <line>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</line>
            <line>and 'gentleman.'</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</line>
            <line>He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</line>
            <line>I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</line>
            <line>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</line>
            <line>There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</line>
            <line>There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</line>
            <line>'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</line>
            <line>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</line>
            <line>See you now;</line>
            <line>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</line>
            <line>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</line>
            <line>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</line>
            <line>By indirections find directions out:</line>
            <line>So by my former lecture and advice,</line>
            <line>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>REYNALDO</speaker>

            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>With what, i' the name of God?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</line>
            <line>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</line>
            <line>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</line>
            <line>Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</line>
            <line>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</line>
            <line>And with a look so piteous in purport</line>
            <line>As if he had been loosed out of hell</line>
            <line>To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>Mad for thy love?</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>My lord, I do not know;</line>
            <line>But truly, I do fear it.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>What said he?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</line>
            <line>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</line>
            <line>And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</line>
            <line>He falls to such perusal of my face</line>
            <line>As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</line>
            <line>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</line>
            <line>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</line>
            <line>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</line>
            <line>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</line>
            <line>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</line>
            <line>And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</line>
            <line>He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</line>
            <line>For out o' doors he went without their helps,</line>
            <line>And, to the last, bended their light on me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</line>
            <line>This is the very ecstasy of love,</line>
            <line>Whose violent property fordoes itself</line>
            <line>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</line>
            <line>As oft as any passion under heaven</line>
            <line>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</line>
            <line>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>OPHELIA</speaker>
            <line>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</line>
            <line>I did repel his fetters and denied</line>
            <line>His access to me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>LORD POLONIUS</speaker>
            <line>That hath made him mad.</line>
            <line>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</line>
            <line>I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,</line>
            <line>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</line>
            <line>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</line>
            <line>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</line>
            <line>As it is common for the younger sort</line>
            <line>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</line>
            <line>This must be known; which, being kept close, might</line>
            <line>move</line>
            <line>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</line>

            <line>Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</line>

            <line>To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;</line>
            <line>But, better look'd into, he truly found</line>
            <line>It was against your highness: whereat grieved,</line>
            <line>That so his sickness, age and impotence</line>
            <line>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</line>
            <line>On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</line>

            <line>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</line>
            <line>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,</line>
            <line>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</line>
            <line>So levied as before, against the Polack:</line>

            <line>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</line>

            <line>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</line>

            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was</line>
            <line>never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the</line>
            <line>play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas</line>
            <line>caviare to the general: but it was--as I received</line>
            <line>it, and others, whose judgments in such matters</line>
            <line>cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well</line>
            <line>digested in the scenes, set down with as much</line>
            <line>modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there</line>
            <line>were no sallets in the lines to make the matter</line>
            <line>savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might</line>
            <line>indict the author of affectation; but called it an</line>
            <line>honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very</line>
            <line>much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I</line>
            <line>chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and</line>
            <line>thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of</line>
            <line>Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin</line>
            <line>at this line: let me see, let me see--</line>
            <line>'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--</line>
            <line>it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--</line>
            <line>'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</line>
            <line>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</line>
            <line>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</line>
            <line>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd</line>
            <line>With heraldry more dismal; head to foot</line>
            <line>Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd</line>
            <line>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</line>
            <line>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</line>
            <line>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</line>
            <line>To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,</line>
            <line>And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,</line>
            <line>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</line>
            <line>Old grandsire Priam seeks.'</line>

            <line>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</line>
            <line>Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,</line>
            <line>Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;</line>
            <line>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</line>
            <line>The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</line>
            <line>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</line>
            <line>Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</line>
            <line>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,</line>
            <line>Which was declining on the milky head</line>
            <line>Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:</line>
            <line>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</line>
            <line>And like a neutral to his will and matter,</line>
            <line>Did nothing.</line>
            <line>But, as we often see, against some storm,</line>
            <line>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</line>
            <line>The bold winds speechless and the orb below</line>
            <line>As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</line>
            <line>Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,</line>
            <line>Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;</line>
            <line>And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall</line>
            <line>On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne</line>
            <line>With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword</line>
            <line>Now falls on Priam.</line>
            <line>Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,</line>

            <line>Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>Is she to be buried in Christian burial that</line>
            <line>wilfully seeks her own salvation?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>
            <line>I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave</line>
            <line>straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it</line>
            <line>Christian burial.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her</line>
            <line>own defence?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>
            <line>Why, 'tis found so.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For</line>
            <line>here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,</line>
            <line>it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it</line>
            <line>is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned</line>
            <line>herself wittingly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>
            <line>Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here</line>
            <line>stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,</line>
            <line>and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he</line>
            <line>goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him</line>
            <line>and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he</line>
            <line>that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>
            <line>But is this law?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>
            <line>Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been</line>
            <line>a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'</line>
            <line>Christian burial.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that</line>
            <line>great folk should have countenance in this world to</line>
            <line>drown or hang themselves, more than their even</line>
            <line>Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient</line>
            <line>gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:</line>
            <line>they hold up Adam's profession.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>
            <line>Was he a gentleman?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>He was the first that ever bore arms.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>
            <line>Why, he had none.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the</line>
            <line>Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'</line>
            <line>could he dig without arms? I'll put another</line>
            <line>question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the</line>
            <line>purpose, confess thyself--</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Clown</speaker>
            <line>The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a</line>
            <line>thousand tenants.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows</line>
            <line>does well; but how does it well? it does well to</line>
            <line>those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the</line>
            <line>gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,</line>
            <line>the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.</line>

            <line>Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull</line>
            <line>ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when</line>
            <line>you are asked this question next, say 'a</line>
            <line>grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till</line>

            <stagedir>He digs and sings</stagedir>
            <line>In youth, when I did love, did love,</line>
            <line>Methought it was very sweet,</line>
            <line>To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,</line>
            <line>O, methought, there was nothing meet.</line>

            <line>Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he</line>
            <line>sings at grave-making?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath</line>
            <line>the daintier sense.</line>

            </line>
            <line>But age, with his stealing steps,</line>
            <line>Hath claw'd me in his clutch,</line>
            <line>And hath shipped me intil the land,</line>
            <line>As if I had never been such.</line>

         <stagedir>Throws up a skull</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:</line>
            <line>how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were</line>
            <line>Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It</line>
            <line>might be the pate of a politician, which this ass</line>
            <line>now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,</line>
            <line>might it not?</line>

            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and</line>
            <line>knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:</line>
            <line>here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to</line>
            <line>see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,</line>

            <line>A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,</line>
            <line>For and a shrouding sheet:</line>
            <line>O, a pit of clay for to be made</line>
            <line>For such a guest is meet.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Throws up another skull</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>
            <line>There's another: why may not that be the skull of a</line>
            <line>lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,</line>
            <line>his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he</line>
            <line>suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the</line>
            <line>sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of</line>
            <line>his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be</line>
            <line>in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,</line>
            <line>his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,</line>
            <line>his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and</line>
            <line>the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine</line>
            <line>pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him</line>
            <line>no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than</line>
            <line>the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The</line>
            <line>very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in</line>
            <line>this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</line>

            <line>Not a jot more, my lord.</line>

            <line>They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>HAMLET</speaker>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Clown</speaker>
            <line>You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not</line>
            <line>yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.</line>

            <line>How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the</line>

            <line>Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of</line>
            <line>it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the</line>
            <line>peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he</line>

            <line>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent</line>
            <line>differences, of very soft society and great showing:</line>
            <line>indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or</line>
            <line>calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the</line>
            <line>continent of what part a gentleman would see.</line>

            <line>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;</line>
            <line>though, I know, to divide him inventorially would</line>
            <line>dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw</line>
            <line>neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the</line>
            <line>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of</line>
            <line>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and</line>
            <line>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his</line>
            <line>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace</line>
            <line>him, his umbrage, nothing more.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>OSRIC</speaker>

            <line>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the</line>

            <line>against six French swords, their assigns, and three</line>
            <line>liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet</line>

            <line>And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!</line>
            <line>Why does the drum come hither?</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>March within</stagedir>
         <stagedir>Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,
and others</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</speaker>
            <line>Where is this sight?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>What is it ye would see?</line>
            <line>If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</speaker>
            <line>This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,</line>
            <line>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,</line>
            <line>That thou so many princes at a shot</line>
            <line>So bloodily hast struck?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Ambassador</speaker>
            <line>The sight is dismal;</line>
            <line>And our affairs from England come too late:</line>
            <line>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,</line>
            <line>To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,</line>
            <line>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:</line>
            <line>Where should we have our thanks?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Not from his mouth,</line>
            <line>Had it the ability of life to thank you:</line>
            <line>He never gave commandment for their death.</line>
            <line>But since, so jump upon this bloody question,</line>
            <line>You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</line>
            <line>Are here arrived give order that these bodies</line>
            <line>High on a stage be placed to the view;</line>
            <line>And let me speak to the yet unknowing world</line>
            <line>How these things came about: so shall you hear</line>
            <line>Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,</line>
            <line>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,</line>
            <line>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,</line>
            <line>And, in this upshot, purposes mistook</line>
            <line>Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I</line>
            <line>Truly deliver.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</speaker>
            <line>Let us haste to hear it,</line>
            <line>And call the noblest to the audience.</line>
            <line>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:</line>
            <line>I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,</line>
            <line>Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>HORATIO</speaker>
            <line>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</line>
            <line>And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;</line>
            <line>But let this same be presently perform'd,</line>
            <line>Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance</line>
            <line>On plots and errors, happen.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</speaker>
            <line>Let four captains</line>
            <line>Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;</line>
            <line>For he was likely, had he been put on,</line>
            <line>To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,</line>
            <line>The soldiers' music and the rites of war</line>
            <line>Speak loudly for him.</line>
            <line>Take up the bodies: such a sight as this</line>
            <line>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.</line>
            <line>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead
bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off</stagedir>

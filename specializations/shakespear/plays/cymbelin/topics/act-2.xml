            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the</line>
            <line>jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a</line>
            <line>hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes</line>
            <line>must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine</line>
            <line>oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Lord</speaker>
            <line>What got he by that? You have broke his pate with</line>

            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>

               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  If his wit had been like him that broke it,</line>
            <line>it would have run all out.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for</line>

            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>No my lord;</line>

            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?</line>

            <line>I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a</line>
            <line>pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;</line>
            <line>they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my</line>
            <line>mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of</line>
            <line>fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that</line>
            <line>nobody can match.</line>

            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,</line>
            <line>cock, with your comb on.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>Sayest thou?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>It is not fit your lordship should undertake every</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit</line>
            <line>offence to my inferiors.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.</line>

            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>Why, so I say.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>First Lord</speaker>
            <line>Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>A stranger, and I not know on't!</line>

            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it</line>
            <line>not.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Lord</speaker>
            <line>There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of</line>

         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,</line>
            <line>whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Lord</speaker>
            <line>One of your lordship's pages.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no</line>
            <line>derogation in't?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>You cannot derogate, my lord.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>Not easily, I think.</line>

            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>
               <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>  You are a fool granted; therefore your</line>
            <line>issues, being foolish, do not derogate.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>CLOTEN</speaker>
            <line>Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost</line>
            <line>to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
            <line>I'll attend your lordship.</line>
            <stagedir>Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord</stagedir>
            <line>That such a crafty devil as is his mother</line>
            <line>Should yield the world this ass! a woman that</line>
            <line>Bears all down with her brain; and this her son</line>
            <line>Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,</line>
            <line>And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,</line>
            <line>Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,</line>
            <line>Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,</line>
            <line>A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer</line>
            <line>More hateful than the foul expulsion is</line>
            <line>Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act</line>
            <line>Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm</line>
            <line>The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked</line>
            <line>That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,</line>

            <line>The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense</line>

            <line>Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd</line>
            <line>The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,</line>
            <line>How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,</line>
            <line>And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!</line>
            <line>But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,</line>
            <line>How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that</line>
            <line>Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper</line>
            <line>Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,</line>
            <line>To see the enclosed lights, now canopied</line>
            <line>Under these windows, white and azure laced</line>
            <line>With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,</line>
            <line>To note the chamber: I will write all down:</line>
            <line>Such and such pictures; there the window; such</line>
            <line>The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,</line>
            <line>Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.</line>
            <line>Ah, but some natural notes about her body,</line>
            <line>Above ten thousand meaner moveables</line>
            <line>Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.</line>
            <line>O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!</line>
            <line>And be her sense but as a monument,</line>
            <line>Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:</line>
            <stagedir>Taking off her bracelet</stagedir>
            <line>As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!</line>
            <line>'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,</line>
            <line>As strongly as the conscience does within,</line>
            <line>To the madding of her lord. On her left breast</line>
            <line>A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops</line>
            <line>I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,</line>
            <line>Stronger than ever law could make: this secret</line>
            <line>Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en</line>
            <line>The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?</line>
            <line>Why should I write this down, that's riveted,</line>
            <line>Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late</line>
            <line>The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down</line>
            <line>Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:</line>

            <line>Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning</line>

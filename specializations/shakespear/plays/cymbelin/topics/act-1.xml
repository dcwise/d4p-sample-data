         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods</line>
            <line>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers</line>
            <line>Still seem as does the king.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>But what's the matter?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom</line>
            <line>He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow</line>
            <line>That late he married--hath referr'd herself</line>
            <line>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;</line>
            <line>Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all</line>
            <line>Is outward sorrow; though I think the king</line>
            <line>Be touch'd at very heart.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>None but the king?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,</line>
            <line>That most desired the match; but not a courtier,</line>
            <line>Although they wear their faces to the bent</line>
            <line>Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not</line>
            <line>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>And why so?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing</line>
            <line>Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--</line>
            <line>I mean, that married her, alack, good man!</line>
            <line>And therefore banish'd--is a creature such</line>
            <line>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</line>
            <line>For one his like, there would be something failing</line>
            <line>In him that should compare. I do not think</line>
            <line>So fair an outward and such stuff within</line>
            <line>Endows a man but he.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>You speak him far.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I do extend him, sir, within himself,</line>
            <line>Crush him together rather than unfold</line>
            <line>His measure duly.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>What's his name and birth?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I cannot delve him to the root: his father</line>
            <line>Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour</line>
            <line>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</line>
            <line>But had his titles by Tenantius whom</line>
            <line>He served with glory and admired success,</line>
            <line>So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;</line>
            <line>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</line>
            <line>Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time</line>
            <line>Died with their swords in hand; for which</line>
            <line>their father,</line>
            <line>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</line>
            <line>That he quit being, and his gentle lady,</line>
            <line>Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased</line>
            <line>As he was born. The king he takes the babe</line>
            <line>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</line>
            <line>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,</line>
            <line>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</line>
            <line>Could make him the receiver of; which he took,</line>
            <line>As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,</line>
            <line>And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--</line>
            <line>Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,</line>
            <line>A sample to the youngest, to the more mature</line>
            <line>A glass that feated them, and to the graver</line>
            <line>A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,</line>
            <line>For whom he now is banish'd, her own price</line>
            <line>Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;</line>
            <line>By her election may be truly read</line>
            <line>What kind of man he is.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I honour him</line>
            <line>Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,</line>
            <line>Is she sole child to the king?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>His only child.</line>
            <line>He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,</line>
            <line>Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,</line>
            <line>I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery</line>
            <line>Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge</line>
            <line>Which way they went.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>How long is this ago?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Some twenty years.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>That a king's children should be so convey'd,</line>
            <line>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,</line>
            <line>That could not trace them!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>Howsoe'er 'tis strange,</line>
            <line>Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,</line>
            <line>Yet is it true, sir.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>I do well believe you.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
            <line>We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
            <line>No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,</line>
            <line>After the slander of most stepmothers,</line>
            <line>Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but</line>
            <line>Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys</line>
            <line>That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,</line>
            <line>So soon as I can win the offended king,</line>
            <line>I will be known your advocate: marry, yet</line>
            <line>The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good</line>
            <line>You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience</line>
            <line>Your wisdom may inform you.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
            <line>Please your highness,</line>
            <line>I will from hence to-day.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
            <line>You know the peril.</line>
            <line>I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</line>
            <line>The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king</line>
            <line>Hath charged you should not speak together.</line>
         </speech>
         <stagedir>Exit</stagedir>

            <speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
            <line>O</line>
            <line>Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant</line>
            <line>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</line>
            <line>I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--</line>
            <line>Always reserved my holy duty--what</line>
            <line>His rage can do on me: you must be gone;</line>
            <line>And I shall here abide the hourly shot</line>
            <line>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,</line>
            <line>But that there is this jewel in the world</line>
            <line>That I may see again.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</speaker>
            <line>My queen! my mistress!</line>
            <line>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</line>
            <line>To be suspected of more tenderness</line>
            <line>Than doth become a man. I will remain</line>
            <line>The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:</line>
            <line>My residence in Rome at one Philario's,</line>
            <line>Who to my father was a friend, to me</line>
            <line>Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,</line>
            <line>And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,</line>
            <line>Though ink be made of gall.</line>

         <stagedir>Re-enter QUEEN</stagedir>
         <speech>
            <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
            <line>Be brief, I pray you:</line>
            <line>If the king come, I shall incur I know not</line>
            <line>How much of his displeasure.</line>
            <stagedir>Aside</stagedir>
            <line>Yet I'll move him</line>
            <line>To walk this way: I never do him wrong,</line>
            <line>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;</line>
            <line>Pays dear for my offences.</line>

            <line>As long a term as yet we have to live,</line>
            <line>The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
            <line>Nay, stay a little:</line>
            <line>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</line>
            <line>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;</line>
            <line>This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;</line>
            <line>But keep it till you woo another wife,</line>

            <line>You gentle gods, give me but this I have,</line>
            <line>And sear up my embracements from a next</line>
            <line>With bonds of death!</line>
            <stagedir>Putting on the ring</stagedir>
            <line>Remain, remain thou here</line>
            <line>While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,</line>
            <line>As I my poor self did exchange for you,</line>
            <line>To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles</line>
            <line>I still win of you: for my sake wear this;</line>
            <line>It is a manacle of love; I'll place it</line>
            <line>Upon this fairest prisoner.</line>
         </speech>

            <line>He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:</line>
            <line>He hath a kind of honour sets him off,</line>
            <line>More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,</line>
            <line>Most mighty princess, that I have adventured</line>
            <line>To try your taking a false report; which hath</line>
            <line>Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment</line>
            <line>In the election of a sir so rare,</line>
            <line>Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him</line>
            <line>Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,</line>
            <line>Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.</line>

            <line>All's well, sir: take my power i' the court</line>
            <line>for yours.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
            <line>My humble thanks. I had almost forgot</line>
            <line>To entreat your grace but in a small request,</line>
            <line>And yet of moment to, for it concerns</line>
            <line>Your lord; myself and other noble friends,</line>
            <line>Are partners in the business.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>

            <speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
            <line>Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--</line>
            <line>The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums</line>
            <line>To buy a present for the emperor</line>
            <line>Which I, the factor for the rest, have done</line>
            <line>In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels</line>
            <line>Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;</line>
            <line>And I am something curious, being strange,</line>
            <line>To have them in safe stowage: may it please you</line>
            <line>To take them in protection?</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
            <line>Willingly;</line>
            <line>And pawn mine honour for their safety: since</line>
            <line>My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them</line>
            <line>In my bedchamber.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
            <line>They are in a trunk,</line>
            <line>Attended by my men: I will make bold</line>
            <line>To send them to you, only for this night;</line>
            <line>I must aboard to-morrow.</line>
         </speech>

            <line>O, no, no.</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
            <line>Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word</line>
            <line>By lengthening my return. From Gallia</line>
            <line>I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise</line>
            <line>To see your grace.</line>

            <line>I thank you for your pains:</line>
            <line>But not away to-morrow!</line>

         <speech>
            <speaker>IACHIMO</speaker>
            <line>O, I must, madam:</line>
            <line>Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please</line>
            <line>To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:</line>
            <line>I have outstood my time; which is material</line>
            <line>To the tender of our present.</line>
         </speech>
         <speech>
            <speaker>IMOGEN</speaker>
            <line>I will write.</line>
            <line>Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,</line>
            <line>And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.</line>

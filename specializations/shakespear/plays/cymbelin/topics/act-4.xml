            <line>serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by</line>
            <line>him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the</line>
            <line>rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said</line>
            <line>a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must</line>
            <line>play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it</line>
            <line>is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer</line>
            <line>in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are</line>
            <line>as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,</line>
            <line>not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the</line>
            <line>advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike</line>
            <line>conversant in general services, and more remarkable</line>
            <line>in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant</line>
            <line>thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!</line>
            <line>Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy</line>
            <line>shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy</line>
            <line>mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before</line>
            <line>thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her</line>
            <line>father; who may haply be a little angry for my so</line>
            <line>rough usage; but my mother, having power of his</line>
            <line>testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My</line>
            <line>horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore</line>
            <line>purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is</line>
            <line>the very description of their meeting-place; and</line>
            <line>the fellow dares not deceive me.</line>

            <line>It is not likely</line>
            <line>That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,</line>
            <line>Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes</line>
            <line>And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,</line>
            <line>That they will waste their time upon our note,</line>
            <line>To know from whence we are.</line>

            <line>O, I am known</line>
            <line>Of many in the army: many years,</line>
            <line>Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him</line>
            <line>From my remembrance. And, besides, the king</line>
            <line>Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;</line>
            <line>Who find in my exile the want of breeding,</line>
            <line>The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless</line>
            <line>To have the courtesy your cradle promised,</line>
            <line>But to be still hot summer's tamings and</line>
            <line>The shrinking slaves of winter.</line>

            <line>Than be so</line>
            <line>Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:</line>
            <line>I and my brother are not known; yourself</line>
            <line>So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,</line>
            <line>Cannot be question'd.</line>

            <line>By this sun that shines,</line>
            <line>I'll thither: what thing is it that I never</line>
            <line>Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,</line>
            <line>But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!</line>
            <line>Never bestrid a horse, save one that had</line>
            <line>A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel</line>
            <line>Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed</line>
            <line>To look upon the holy sun, to have</line>
            <line>The benefit of his blest beams, remaining</line>
            <line>So long a poor unknown.</line>

            <line>I'll take the better care, but if you will not,</line>

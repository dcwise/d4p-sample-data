   <title>8 Conclusion</title>

        <p>We have seen that there are three independent pieces of evidence, all of which
          point to the occurrence of a big bang: (i) the recession of the galaxies; (ii) the cosmic
          microwave background; and (iii) the comparison between the calculated primordial nuclear
          abundances and the present-day composition of matter in the Universe. For these various
          reasons, the vast majority of cosmologists today accept that there was a big bang. This
          acceptance has been given extra support by the agreement between the value of the
          present-day baryonic mass density indicated by abundance measurements, and the value of
          that same quantity deduced from anisotropies in the cosmic background
          radiation.</p>
        <p>In this unit, we have seen two snapshots of the development of the Universe: the
          period of nuclear synthesis which shaped today's nuclear abundances; and the later period
          of decoupling from which emerged today's 3 K radiation.
          In looking at how these two epochs fit into the
          overall pattern of the Universe's evolution, one of the aims is to try and push our
          description as far back in time as we can towards the very instant of the big bang;
          another is to look as far ahead into the future as we can so as to uncover what might be
          the likely end of the Universe.</p>

   <title>6.1 Basic isotropy</title>

      <section>
          
          <p>As we have said, the photons in the 3 K background have been practically free
            from interaction with anything since about 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> years after
            the instant of the big bang. The present <i>angular distribution</i> of the microwave
            radiation – the way in which it is spread across the sky – is therefore
            almost the same as it was then. The spectrum we find today depends on the temperatures
            at that time – for the intensity of the radiation in a particular region of the
            early Universe depended <i>only</i> on the temperature. If the Universe at that time was
            inhomogeneous (in the sense of being hotter in some regions than others) the 3 K
            radiation observed today would be more intense in some directions than in
            others.</p>
          <p>In fact, as we have indicated, the radiation is largely isotropic. There are,
            however, some small – some <i>very</i> small – but significant departures
            from perfect isotropy. But before these can be identified, we have to take into account
            the effect of the Earth's motion. This would in any event impose an apparent asymmetry
            on the radiation. Indeed, as we shall now show, this effect can be turned to our
            advantage and provide us with a means for measuring the speed of the Earth relative to
            the average distribution of matter and energy in the Universe.</p>

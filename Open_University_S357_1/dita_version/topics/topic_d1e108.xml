         <lclcObjectivesStem>By the end of this unit you should be able to:</lclcObjectivesStem>
         <lcObjectivesGroup>
            <lcObjective>describe the characteristics of light emitted by stars, and hence the
        information of cosmological interest that can be deduced from it;</lcObjective>
            <lcObjective>distinguish between true and false statements relevant to the distribution
        and motion of stars within galaxies, and of galaxies within clusters and
        superclusters;</lcObjective>
            <lcObjective>outline the methods used for estimating the distances to stars and to
        galaxies;</lcObjective>
            <lcObjective>explain and apply Hubbleâ€™s law;</lcObjective>
            <lcObjective>distinguish between various sources of redshift and estimate their relative
        importance in a given situation;</lcObjective>
            <lcObjective>describe the cosmic microwave radiation in terms of its origin, its thermal
        nature, and how its temperature has changed with time;</lcObjective>
            <lcObjective>explain how observations of thermal radiation are affected by the motion of
        the observer with respect to it;</lcObjective>
            <lcObjective>outline the evidence concerning the isotropy of the
        Universe;</lcObjective>
            <lcObjective>describe the most important basic nuclear reactions taking place in the early
        stages of the big bang, and how the final mix of elements produced provides evidence today
        for the big bang.</lcObjective>

      <p>In this unit, we present the three main lines of experimental evidence pointing to
        the big bang origin of the Universe: (i) the recession of the galaxies; (ii) the microwave
        remnant of the early fireball; and (iii) the comparison between the calculated primordial
        nuclear abundances and the present-day composition of matter in the Universe. </p>
      <p>A data sheet of useful information is provided as a pdf for your use. You may wish
        to print out a copy to keep handy as you progress through the unit.</p>

          observe what tags they use as well. </p><p>Tagging involves a skill that many technical writers haveâ€”determining which keywords best
          describe a link or image for retrieval later. Social bookmarking sites like delicious.com
          and digg.com<indexterm>digg.com</indexterm> use tagging, or keywords, to help users find
          their links later or group them into categories. What is more advanced and social about
          tagging or social bookmarking is that the tags that others use and the content that they
          have tagged are usually visible to anyone. </p><p>There are literally hundreds of <indexterm>communities<indexterm>social bookmarking

          communication.</p><p>You may find other social bookmarking sites are useful for your particular users, such as
          reddit.com, stumbleupon.com, and furl.com.</p></body></subsection>

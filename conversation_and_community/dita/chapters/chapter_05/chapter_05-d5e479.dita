<subsection id="d5e479"><title>Instant messaging and responses</title><body><p>You have probably noticed that many websites now contain “<indexterm>Live
            Help</indexterm><indexterm>help, live</indexterm>Live Help” links. If your corporate
          site includes such links, you might find out how the live help is staffed and volunteer to
          be a staffer for an hour or longer, exchanging instant messages with real customers. </p><p>Interesting examples exist of scripted response programs written for frequently asked
          questions, using artificial intelligence stored in knowledge reserves, dictionaries, or
          other reference materials such as concordances to guess at a needed response. For example,
          IRC has a helper robot called IRCza that is natural language artificial intelligence chat
          robot for IRC.<fn>

          </fn> AOL Instant Messenger offers AIMbots, which can tell you when movies are going to
          show. According to the paper “Using Instant Messaging to Provide an Intelligent Learning
          Environment,” <indexterm>Artificial Intelligence Markup Language
          (AIML)</indexterm>Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML)<fn>
            <p> http://www.alicebot.org/TR/2001/WD-aiml/</p>
          </fn> is an XML-compliant language that facilitates the creation of “<indexterm>chatbots</indexterm>chatbots” with various personalities and kinds of knowledge. By
          connecting the chatbot to a support knowledge base of frequent responses, you might be
          able to offer a virtual conversation with responses to a customer.</p></body></subsection>

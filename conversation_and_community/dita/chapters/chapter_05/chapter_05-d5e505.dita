          community member recommendations before or while making a purchase. To encourage and
          participate in social shopping, you could read a book that is related to the types of
          problems your customers solve with your product, then go to amazon.com and write a book
          review for a book related to your product or expertise that your company provides. Or, you
          could perform a search on amazon.com using keywords that are helpful to your users to get
          a sense of who else is reading and reviewing those books and what problems theyâ€™re
          solving.</p></body></subsection>

          read <indexterm>blogs<indexterm>reading</indexterm></indexterm>blogs. Follow the ones that
          interest you personally and professionally by using an RSS feed reader<indexterm>feed

          and collecting subscriptions to blogs, you will notice the discussions in the <indexterm>comments<indexterm>on blog posts</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>comments<indexterm>on blog posts</indexterm></indexterm>comments. Once you feel confident and interested
          enough in a topic or post that you can contribute a <indexterm>conversations<indexterm>joining</indexterm></indexterm>comment, write your comment, and make that connection.
          If beginning even an internal-audience blog is intimidating, consider your first foray
          into blogging to be commenting on otherâ€™s internal blogs. And you certainly should read
          blogs often before beginning to write for one yourself to get a sense of style, tone, and
          voice. </p></body></subsection>

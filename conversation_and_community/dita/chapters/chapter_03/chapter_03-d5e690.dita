          customers can edit or remix themselves. If products are not open source, but users are
          accustomed to early revisions of the documentation, they may have their expectations for
          content already set. A writer in an enabler role would do well to keep up with user
          expectations and analyze the conversations occurring about the social media tools in
          use.</p></body></subsection>

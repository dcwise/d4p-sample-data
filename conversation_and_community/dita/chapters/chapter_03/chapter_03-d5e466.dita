<subsection id="d5e466"><title>The documentation environment</title><body><p>What is the lifecycle of the products that you document? If your company releases products
        often, your users may expect documentation updates every release. A wiki may be the best way
        to fulfill this expectation. If the product releases only once every other year, you can
        invest in conversations during those longer release cycles by using a different format, such
        as customer <indexterm>discussions about content<indexterm>in
        forums</indexterm></indexterm>forums, blogs, or podcasts.</p><p>What are the current technical publications deliverables? If your team still relies heavily
        on printed documentation, you might not have an efficient method for getting feedback from
        or conversing with customers. If you continue to deliver printed documentation, you will
        want to find online methods for enabling conversation and community. If you do not already
        have a method for gathering feedback on printed documentation, investigate the costs and
        returns of sending printed-format surveys or questionnaires.</p></body></subsection>

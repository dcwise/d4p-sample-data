<subsection id="d5e786"><title>Piloting and testing internal solution first</title><body><p>It is very easy to stumble while practicing the art of conversation and community, so you
          might want to try internal conversations first. For example, start an internal
            wiki<indexterm>wikis<indexterm>collaboration in</indexterm></indexterm> so that you and
          your team can become accustomed to the new way of working and communicating. </p><p>Stewart Mader, author of <i>Wikipatterns </i>touts the value and necessity of using a
          pilot project to start wikis, and I believe this approach would work best for implementing
          any type of social media. This technology is still relatively experimental, and you should
          allow your team to experiment to find the strengths and weaknesses of a new delivery
          mechanism or community system.</p></body></subsection>

      Koestler</epigram><p>As a writer, you need to find the correct value proposition for your work and determine
      whether your role is an enabler of conversation or an instigator of conversation. In a world
      of rock star coders, you want to find out whether you are a sage on stage or a stage hand. Or
      perhaps your evaluation will determine that no social media action is the correct action.</p><p>You might already be aware of the challenges of introducing Web 2.0 or community-driven
      content in an enterprise environment. Many people are skeptics, asking for proof of the
      efficacy of the methods. This chapter discusses strategies for determining your role and
      offers strategies for a phased approach to integrating the social web in your writing. </p></body></chapter>

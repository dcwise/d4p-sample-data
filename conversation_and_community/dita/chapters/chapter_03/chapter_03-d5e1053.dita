<subsection id="d5e1053"><title>Measuring whether a documentation conversation works </title><body><p>This question, “But does documentation as conversation work?” stems from the <indexterm>metrics<indexterm>social media implementation</indexterm></indexterm>measurability
          equation. Those who are interested in website metrics and analytics often want some fancy
          tool to take care of the measurements for them. But, in reality, it is extremely difficult
          to know what measuring stick you can use on a blog entry, for example, or the value of a
          well-stocked wiki. Measuring community involvement is often discussed in fuzzy vague terms
          and not hard numbers. So, if you apply conversation or community methods to <indexterm>technical documentation<indexterm>measuring effectiveness
          of</indexterm></indexterm>documentation, how do you prove it is working? And how do you
          prove the level to which it’s working and whether it outpaces conventional user assistance
          methods? </p><p>Website analytical tools like <indexterm>metrics<indexterm>Google

          Analytics help you count numbers of visitors, and the tools are getting more sophisticated
          about measuring how long each visitor stays. Also, they are better able to track the path
          that users take through a help system, which can help you measure their effectiveness.
          Plus, Google’s <indexterm>help, online<indexterm>tracking

          which <indexterm>search<indexterm>keywords</indexterm></indexterm>keywords are most
          searched for and may help you analyze which <indexterm>metrics<indexterm>keywords</indexterm></indexterm>keywords are most efficient for letting a user figure
          out the answer and move on. Time spent on a page may or may not be a good measurement for
          effectiveness of a help system, but findability<indexterm>findability</indexterm> of your
          help system is measurable. You can also ask your audience if their participation in
          conversation or community has prevented them from leaving a company or abandoning a
          product from a particular company. Often we don’t measure in the sense of preventing a
          negative result.</p><p><indexterm>community equity</indexterm>Community equity is an emerging research area that
          measures the value that an individual brings as a member of an online community. Peter
          Reiser at Sun Microsystems has developed a method and algorithm for calculating a member’s
          community equity based on information offerings and personal interactions with others. His
          team also created widgets that help people see other members equity ratings and central
          areas of expertise. By reading, rating, contributing, tagging, and editing, a person
          increases their <indexterm>information equity</indexterm>information equity. Personal
          equity is calculated based on connections, reputation, and collaborative efforts. The
          values “age” and decrease to zero over time so there is a “freshness” to the values. Peter
          Reiser’s project is now available as an <indexterm>open source<indexterm>community equity

          by <indexterm>Hurley, William (whurley)</indexterm>William Hurley (known as Whurley)
          titled “20 Reasons Why Microsoft Loves Open Source.” Whurley’s blog entry it was intended
          to draw attention and managed to get on the front page of active online communities such
          as Slashdot and Digg. It could cost $800,000 dollars to gain similar media coverage. That
          is one method to measure conversations, though <indexterm>whurley (William

          competitors does not fit nicely into our usual methods of delivering quality information
          in a timely manner. </p><p>So, how could you measure whether a technical publication-based conversation is working?
          My first suggestion is to go to the usual metrics that technical publication uses to
          provide value—for example, lowered support costs. Or, perhaps it is not Return on

          Just as competing products need to keep up with each other’s features, I think that we
          need to keep an eye on competitor’s conversations and determine if there’s a perceived
          value your company should match.</p></body></subsection>

          life—home life, school life, and work life. As a result, expectations for technical
          documentation are shifting. Prior to the Internet, people would carefully store printed
          manuals on a bookshelf for reference. Today, people use a search engine as their starting
          point for troubleshooting a device. For example, I still see click-throughs from people
          searching for “BMC Performance Manager” nearly two years after posting blog entries about
          the BMC Software product “Performance Manager.” The small book that comes with a consumer
          device may still be the best place to look for assistance, especially because of the
          multiple translations available for international audiences. Yet a visual, video-loving
          user may search on You Tube for troubleshooting advice. And others might just use the
          interface itself until they figure it out. Still others might consider a friend or
          co-worker the best source of technical expertise, so documentation is rarely used by the
          inquirer (although certainly the expert friends or co-workers are intimately familiar with
          their favorite sources of technical information.)</p></body></subsection>

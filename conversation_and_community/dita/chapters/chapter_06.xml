    <epigram>Your wiki is not Wikipedia.&#8232;—Stewart Mader</epigram>
    <p>The recent explosion of wikis hosted on the Internet and the extreme success of Wikipedia,
      the largest online reference encyclopedia, has led to discussions about where a wiki might fit
      into technical documentation. Originally created in 1995 for making quick web pages, wiki
      means “quick” in Hawaiian and is now synonymous with collaborative authoring. Over 90 wiki
      applications are available, and most offer cross-platform, cross-browser pages. Wikis
      encourage collaboration because they allow any one with the right permissions to edit any web
      page, and many wikis can even reconcile differences when two authors edit the same article at
      the same time. </p>
    <p>Wikis represent a shift towards living, breathing, changing documentation, and not all
      writers are certain of their value or place in <indexterm>technical documentation<indexterm
          >wikis and</indexterm></indexterm>technical deliverables. I believe that wikis encourage
      crowd-sourcing, or delegating work to a large group of semi-organized individuals (a crowd),
      and help writers see customers’ view points. Customers might expect a wiki when a customer
        <indexterm>forums<indexterm>compared to wikis</indexterm></indexterm>forum does not provide
      enough information to answer their questions or when scrolling through multiple answers on a
      forum becomes tedious. </p>
    <p>Wikis are good for project management and communication, for information gathering and
      collection of source material, and for content delivery. Wikis can be either the source of
      your content or the published deliverable from another source. This chapter talks about both
      sourcing models and also contains a roundtrip discussion, where the content goes to a wiki and
      the wiki articles come back to a source file to be modified again and again. </p>
    <p>Using wikis for project <indexterm>wikis<indexterm
        >enterprise</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>wikis<indexterm>collaboration
        in</indexterm></indexterm>collaboration is an important model and one that is prevalent in
      today’s workplace. Scott Abel, creator of The Content Wrangler, and Stewart Mader, author of
      Wikipatterns and wiki adoption consultant, recently collaborated on some research into wiki
      use in the enterprise, producing a report titled “Why Businesses Don’t Collaborate.”<fn>
        <p>
          http://www.scribd.com/doc/16336782/Why-Businesses-Dont-Collaborate-Meeting-Management-Group-Input-and-Wiki-Usage-Survey-Results</p>
      </fn> In their report they discuss uses of the enterprise wiki, which is a wiki behind a
      corporate firewall. The security layer for this type of wiki is based on the credentials
      already established for company email and the company network. By using the enterprise wiki
      rather than relying on email for tasks like distributing meeting agendas and posting meeting
      minutes, people save time, work together, and distribute updates and information more easily.
      One responder to the survey noted, “I’ve found that people are much more likely to participate
      when they can just go update wiki pages vs. reviewing formal/traditional documents.” </p>
    <p>I also believe that wikis are not always the best-fit application, depending on the business
      needs for the wiki. Some disadvantages for wikis include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Portability: A wiki often is run from a server and even though web servers are becoming
        smaller and smaller on disk, gathering up all the pieces to create a portable wiki may not
        be practical.</li>
      <li>Connectivity requirements: Wikis are often online-only content, so people cannot browse a
        wiki on an airplane, for example.</li>
      <li>Access control choices and implications: People’s perceptions of wikis are that they
        should be open for editing, but if you want to use a wiki just to enable <indexterm
            >collaboration<indexterm>wikis and</indexterm></indexterm>comments, you might not meet
        some users expectations.</li>
      <li>Output deliverables: Many wikis offer output formats ranging from PDF to content for a
        mobile smartphone, but those may not meet your users standards for output quality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In March and April of 2008, 493 people responded to a survey from the Center for Information
      Development Management that asked about publishing practices and information management
      techniques. More than half of the respondents said they use wikis internally but just 9% use
      wikis for externally facing documents.<fn>
        <p> http://www.cidmblog.com/?q=node/33</p>
      </fn> My interpretation is that we are getting more practice using wikis for project
      management and internal collaboration, but we are not yet replacing traditional <indexterm
        >help, online<indexterm>compared to wikis</indexterm></indexterm>help systems with wikis. </p>
    <p>Wiki<indexterm>wikis<indexterm>comparison to online help</indexterm></indexterm> applications
      offer many advantages over traditional HTML publication methods. From Microsoft’s early
      WinHelp to Compiled HTML Help format (CHM)<indexterm>CHM</indexterm> to the open source
      Eclipse help<indexterm>Eclipse help</indexterm>, we have seen a growing demand for user
      assistance systems designed to be cross-platform and network friendly. Many wikis use wikitext
      for editing, a simplified markup language that is often an alternative to HTML coding. There
      are also some pitfalls to avoid when using wikitext<indexterm>wikitext<indexterm
          >example</indexterm></indexterm> instead of traditional <indexterm>HTML<indexterm>used in
          wikis</indexterm></indexterm>HTML markup, however. For example, wikitext is not exactly
      the same for every engine so learning one wikitext syntax is not transferable to another wiki.
      Some wikitext is <indexterm>HTML<indexterm>used in wikis</indexterm></indexterm>HTML-based,
      other wikitext is text-based. </p>
    <p>Following are some ways that <indexterm>technical documentation<indexterm>wikis
          and</indexterm></indexterm>wikis are different from traditional user assistance systems. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Editing: The “wikitext” markup used by many wikis is meant to be simple and easy to
        use</li>
      <li>Linking: Many wikis allow page-name-based linking to other wiki pages, or simple HTML
        linking methods</li>
      <li>Subscribing options: RSS<indexterm>RSS (Really Simple Syndication)<indexterm>subscribing
            to wikis</indexterm></indexterm> feeds for recent changes, “watch” pages for edits</li>
      <li>Searching:<indexterm>wikis<indexterm>searching in</indexterm></indexterm> Search<indexterm
            >search<indexterm>in wikis</indexterm></indexterm> engine technology often is
        included</li>
      <li>Scalability: Many pages edited by many authors </li>
      <li>Access control: Registration and logins can control authoring privileges</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To quote the introduction to the CommonCraft video instructions for wikis, “wiki web sites
      are easy to use, but hard to describe.” I recommend their video, Wikis in Plain English, for
      an introduction to wikis and how they work in less than four minutes’ time.<fn>
        <p> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dnL00TdmLY</p>
      </fn></p>
    <p>Learning about different <indexterm>wikis<indexterm>learning
      about</indexterm></indexterm>wikis and how they work should involve hands-on exercises as well
      as reading and watching videos about wikis. Many wikis offer a sandbox area so that you can
      see the editor and try your hand at wiki editing.</p>
    <p> shows a troubleshooting page on the <indexterm>One Laptop per Child<indexterm
          >wiki</indexterm></indexterm>One Laptop per Child wiki at wiki.laptop.org. It has a table
      of contents advance organizer feature built in to the wiki page, a graphic, navigation in the
      sidebar, and a visible search form. The tabs at the top are prominent features of the wiki,
      enabling users to discuss, edit, and view a history of the page. </p>
    <p>wiki.laptop.org while displaying a page</p>
    <p>Even without logging in, a user can click the edit tab in this particular wiki. When you
      click the edit tab, you see a new interface that shows the editor window. In , the wikitext is
      text-based. For example, the three equals signs in a row (===) on each end of a phrase
      indicate a heading. </p>
    <p>wiki.laptop.org while editing a page</p>
    <p>The website wikimatrix.org, a comprehensive tool that describes wiki applications and lets
      you run side-by-side comparisons, uses the following categories to evaluate wikis:</p>
    <p>When evaluating <indexterm>evaluation<indexterm>of wiki
      applications</indexterm></indexterm>wikis, just like any technology tools, you should first
      decide the business needs and use cases for the wiki. After gathering use cases, determine the
      fit for the list of wiki applications that meet your business objectives and use cases. </p>
    <p>Another practical consideration for selecting a wiki application is whether it uses a
        <indexterm>wikis<indexterm>database-driven</indexterm></indexterm>database to serve up the
      content. If you need access to the content for repurposing, versioning, backing up, or
      translating, how easy is it to get access to the data structures? Are you more comfortable
      with database commands or file copy commands and automation? </p>
    <p>You want to determine the license that you use for the content created on your <indexterm
          >wikis<indexterm>licensing content</indexterm></indexterm>wiki so that you can decide if
      creating new deliverables from the wiki source and sharing the content is allowed. </p>
    <p>The editing syntax for wikis varies widely. Some use HTML and some use <indexterm
          >wikis<indexterm>syntax</indexterm></indexterm>wikitext for editing. Wikitext is a markup
      language that usually simplifies the markup further than just HTML, using conventions such as
      asterisks * for bullets and square brackets [] to indicate linked text. Will your users tend
      to spend time in a WYSIWYG editor, or will they be more comfortable in a particular
        wikitext<indexterm>wikitext<indexterm>varied syntax</indexterm></indexterm>, and if so, what
      wikitext do they already know? Do most of your users already know rudimentary HTML<indexterm
          >HTML<indexterm>used in wikis</indexterm></indexterm> markup?</p>
    <p>How about <indexterm>wikis<indexterm>scripting support</indexterm></indexterm>scripting
      support within the wiki? Some wiki applications enable programmatic solutions within a page,
      such as creating a table of contents automatically or enabling embedded pages within pages.
      Are you going to have editors who will want advanced features that scripting offers, such as
      embedded expanding tables of contents or publishing items from an RSS feed? Scripts may solve
      some web publishing problems, but for a casual wiki editor, scripted instructions add to the
      complexity of viewing the wikitext. </p>
    <p>Like HTML help systems, wiki syntax should give you the ability to easily link to other wiki
      pages and to external sources. Be aware of how difficult or easy it is to link to non-wiki
      resources with the wiki markup offered by the wiki application you are evaluating.</p>
    <p>An added benefit of wikis is the ability to subscribe to RSS feeds that enable you or other
      wiki users to “watch” what pages are being edited. Find out the granularity of what changes
      you can be notified on—is it per article, per page, per category, per section? </p>
    <p>While setting up search engines within a traditional help system is often difficult, most
      wiki applications build in easy search mechanisms within the body of the wiki. Find out if you
      can integrate another search engine with the wiki application or if you must use the one
      shipped with the wiki. </p>

    <title>Starting or reinvigorating a wiki</title>

      <p>A wiki is not always the answer to the question being asked. One of my favorite quotes
        about a <indexterm>communities<indexterm>wikis supporting</indexterm></indexterm>wiki is
        from a blog article in which the author told a story about how starting a wiki was in
        reality just a procrastination attempt—put off the real work of collaborating and

          <p> http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=71</p>
        </fn> It’s so true that the hardest part about working on a wiki is not writing the content
        but building the trust and relationships that will ensure the wiki continues to grow and
        thrive. So if you are ready to work on growing wiki use<indexterm>adopting wikis in

              Warcraft</indexterm></indexterm>World of Warcraft. This particular wiki’s community
          wants strategy articles and reference information for their wiki; users’ technical or
          how-to questions or discussions are roundly dismissed, and the community shapes the wiki
          in the way they want it to be.<fn>
            <p> Based on my notes from a 2008 SXSWi panel, Edit Me: How Gamers are Adopting the Wiki

          have a list of preferred action words for tasks and steps, or a description of how you
          capitalize headings or the titles of wiki pages, to standardize your wiki’s URLs. Embed
          your wiki style guide directly on the wiki itself as a wiki page. Make sure that your own
          contributions consistently follow a style guide. </p>
        <p>A style guide can also describe which <indexterm>wikis<indexterm
            >categories</indexterm></indexterm>categories are helpful in your wiki, and some of the
          background decisions for choosing those categories. As an example, the OLPC Wiki has a
          Style Guide page<fn>
            <p> http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Style_guide</p>
          </fn> that helps new contributors understand the structure and organization of the wiki.
          The Firefox Support Knowledge Base has a comprehensive style guide<fn>
            <p> http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Style+Guide</p>
          </fn> that also refers contributors to Sun Microsystem’s style guide, <ph>Read Me First! A
            Style Guide for the Computer Industry</ph>. If contributors do not follow the style
          guide, even with reminders, decide if you want to edit the text to match the style guide
          or if the community will accept the text without strict adherence to a style guide.</p>
        <p>Another way of defining style is determining a “<indexterm>wikis<indexterm
              >voice</indexterm></indexterm>voice” for your wiki. Decide ahead of time the types of
          information and word choices that the wiki pages reflect. Refer to Chapter 7, “Finding

        <p>Another way to help users get comfortable making edits is to purposely leave typos in

        <p>A how-to guide may be helpful for describing common tasks, such as starting an editable

            and</indexterm></indexterm>comments, or rounds of aggressive edits in which one
          contributor is pitted against another for the “truth” or being “right.” When this type of

          your company will have to take a stand. Either way, be sure to have a written policy

        <p>You may also determine that a particular wiki’s architecture model allows for only one
          wiki article per topic, but multiple wiki articles could be true for each topic. For

          A common model for many groups is to have an internal <indexterm>wikis<indexterm
              >publishing models</indexterm></indexterm>wiki where drafts are published and
          discussion occurs, and an external wiki that houses the content that is considered
          “warranted.” For example, <indexterm>FLOSS Manuals<indexterm
          >wiki</indexterm></indexterm>FLOSS Manuals has a “<indexterm>wikis<indexterm>write
              area</indexterm></indexterm>Write” area where all content remains while it is still in
          draft stage and a “<indexterm>wikis<indexterm>read area</indexterm></indexterm>Read” area
          to which wiki pages are published when the content is ready. A small group of writers with
          “Maintainer” privileges has the capability to move content from the “Write” area to the
          “Read” area.</p>
        <p><indexterm>Dyer, Lisa</indexterm>Lisa Dyer, a development manager at Lombardi Software,
          uses a similar model in maintaining three wikis. The <indexterm>collaboration<indexterm

          analysts, quality testers, and information developers to write, display, and discuss use
          cases, test plans, and other software documentation artifacts. Guaranteed, tested content
          is published to an external-facing wiki, and only information developers have full control
          over editing the wiki pages. Customers, using their support ID to log on to the wiki, can

            a<indexterm>content<indexterm>wiki</indexterm></indexterm> wiki is sufficient for
          delivering the <indexterm>content<indexterm>integrating</indexterm></indexterm>information
          a customer needs, a wiki alone is not sufficient for many audiences and products. If you
          produce a wiki in addition to other deliverables for a product, you need to integrate the
          wiki with the documentation set so that it looks like the rest of your documentation,
          follows your style requirements, and is included in search and indexing tools. If you need
          to set the wiki apart because it is unvetted content, or because it contains only
          tutorials or specialized content, it still should follow corporate guidelines for visual
          style. </p>
        <p>If a wiki’s look and feel is widely different from other deliverables, the wiki may
          appear like an afterthought or unneeded part of the documentation set. <indexterm>Johnson,
            Tom</indexterm>Tom Johnson, on idratherbewriting.com, also found that the scope of the
            search<indexterm>search<indexterm>in wikis</indexterm></indexterm> boxes is an important
          usability aspect of integrating the wiki with other content in your documentation set. Tom
          voices his concerns about user assistance that is fragmented and in too many locations
          without a unifying search or theme.<fn>
            <p>

          </fn> When users are within a stand-alone help system, they may not know that a wiki
          exists. Finding ways to expand the user assistance system to include the wiki or support
            <indexterm>forums<indexterm>searching through online help</indexterm></indexterm>forums
          in a search would help direct readers to the conversation-based content. </p>
        <p>You may find that you can single-source to initially build a wiki. Webworks.com offers
          publishing to wikitext from multiple types of source files. One XML-based standard for
          technical documentation, the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA), enables the
          DITA2Wiki <indexterm>open source<indexterm>DITA2Wiki</indexterm></indexterm>open source
          project which offers a framework to use DITA source files to populate a wiki. Other
          projects such as the Mylyn <indexterm>MediaWiki<indexterm>transform to
            DITA</indexterm></indexterm>MediaWiki to DITA project<fn>
            <p> http://greensopinion.blogspot.com/2008/11/mylyn-wikitext-targets-oasis-dita.html</p>
          </fn> have found ways to transform wikitext<indexterm>wikitext<indexterm>transform from
              XML</indexterm></indexterm> into XML files. Another workflow is to author in a wiki
          and output PDF<indexterm>PDF, as wiki output</indexterm> files as books from the wiki.
            <indexterm>wikislices</indexterm>Wikislices are another method for extracting a book
          from a specific set of wiki pages. But wiki integration could also mean supplying a wiki
          with updated articles but then use a <indexterm>wikis<indexterm
            >slicing</indexterm></indexterm>wikislicing technique to pull those articles back into
          user assistance that is delivered in another way. </p>
        <p>Another aspect of integrating a wiki with other content is ensuring that an online
          identity is associated with the wiki. For example, if a login ID is already required for
          access to your customer support website, perhaps your wiki could use the same login
          credentials, lending credibility to the wiki because only supported customers could edit
          the content.</p>

          findings of the research he had completed on online user forum participation. He studied

          online <indexterm>forums<indexterm>contributions to</indexterm></indexterm>forums, and
          newsgroups, which are the natural predecessors of wikis. His article concludes with
          suggestions on how to move those numbers slightly either towards more contributors or
          towards more lurkers and fewer elite contributors (which may also be a desired result).
          His first suggestion is to recognize that these numbers have been observed for years and
          that you can’t really change these values by much—perhaps by only a few tenths of a
          percent. </p>
        <p>Nielsen’s suggestions include ideas that are easily transferred to user assistance or to
          wiki contributions. First, make it easy to contribute quickly, such as offering star
          rating capability instead of only a web form. The ability to rate an article is included
          in many online help systems, and exposing the <indexterm>help, online<indexterm>rating
              topics</indexterm></indexterm>ratings to the reader helps to determine how “well-worn”
          a help topic is. With forum software you can also determine the value of a community
          member’s contributions based on reputation systems.</p>
        <p>Another suggestion is to make <indexterm>participation<indexterm>as a side
              effect</indexterm></indexterm>participation a side effect. I’ve explored this idea in
          a blog post, looking for ideas on how to make a user assistance system show the fine lines
          of wear, like a cookbook that falls open to your favorite recipe because the binding has
          been flattened on your kitchen countertop.<fn>
            <p> http://justwriteclick.com/2008/05/28/can-online-help-show-read-wear/</p>
          </fn> This indicator of use is called “read wear.” Here are some of the ideas to indicate
          “read wear” that I came up with and people who commented on my blog entry added to. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Model a wiki‘s “most active pages” feature, which shows the page with the most edits.
            However, the page with the most edits may be more controversial than truthful, so the
            most popular pages might be more useful.</li>
          <li>When a user searches, show the <indexterm>search<indexterm
              >relevance</indexterm></indexterm>most searched-for terms. Users might connect
            concepts more easily when they understand what others are searching for. </li>
          <li>Show the most recently viewed knowledge base articles or most popular articles. I
            found that useful in the past when searching through BMC Software’s rich knowledge base.
            Just as CNN and other news sites offer a list of the <indexterm>help, online<indexterm
                >most emailed topics</indexterm></indexterm>most <indexterm>email<indexterm
                >tracking</indexterm></indexterm>emailed stories per hour, you could show the most
              emailed<indexterm>help, online<indexterm>emailing topics</indexterm></indexterm>
            online help topics. </li>
          <li>Use <indexterm>tagging<indexterm>online help</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm
                >content<indexterm>tagging</indexterm></indexterm>tag <indexterm>clouds,
              tag</indexterm>clouds to display read wear as well, with the largest tag indicating
            the highest number of topics on that subject that users have tagged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I found that popularity, time spent on the page, rating on a page, and number of edits on
          a page are the strongest to weakest indicators of read wear for an online content
          system.</p>
        <p>Nielsen also encourages the use of <indexterm>content<indexterm>templates
            for</indexterm></indexterm>templates and draft content so that users don’t have to start
          from a blank page. I know a writer who pre-filled as many technical articles with as much
          information as he could before sending the draft copies to his Subject Matter Expert
          (SME). The SME, a recognized programmer who built software for electronic keyboards,
          happily added content into the pre-filled articles.</p>
        <p>Nielsen also says to <indexterm>forums<indexterm>rewarding participation
            in</indexterm></indexterm>reward, but not over-reward, participants, and he encourages
          the use of a reputation system. I especially like the idea of moderate rewards for
          participation so that dominant profiles do not take over the community. Balance is key,
          along with recognizing that you won’t overcome the community makeup.</p>
        <p>Growing your community should also contribute to the growth of <indexterm

          it’s possible to have 30 contributing heavily to your wiki project if the 1% large
          contribution number holds throughout the community’s growth.</p>
        <p>Some wiki examples show variances in these percentages, but as described earlier, certain
          best practices can shift the participant percentages. Following are two examples of wikis

          done by just .7% of the users ... 524 people.” Aaron Swartz describes the story he saw
          from his studies as follows:</p>
        <lq>
          <p>“When you put it all together, the story become [sic] clear: an outsider makes one edit
            to add a chunk of information, then insiders make several edits tweaking and
            reformatting it. In addition, insiders rack up thousands of edits doing things like
            changing the name of a category across the entire site—the kind of thing only insiders
            deeply care about. As a result, insiders account for the vast majority of the edits. But
            it’s the outsiders who provide nearly all of the content.” <fn>

          of the community contributes content), you can shift those numbers slightly by recruiting
          others in your company to offer their perspectives to the wiki and do minor edits and
          upkeep when needed. Have someone from customer support keep an eye on the recent changes
          or <indexterm>collaboration<indexterm>wikis and</indexterm></indexterm>comments

      <body>
        <p>A wiki is an open documentation system that may reveal flaws in the system faster than
          you might like. Also, wiki collaboration can be a tricky balancing act, and if your
          writing team does not already collaborate and share well, a wiki may cause battles over
          who can see and edit which content items, and lead to other technology-based secrecy

        <p>If your customers have not requested a wiki, there’s no need to build one or coerce them
          into thinking they need one. Instead, “wiki-fy” your documentation set by thinking about
          other aspects of wikis that you could adopt without actually using a wiki. How about a
          comment or a <indexterm>help, online<indexterm>rating topics</indexterm></indexterm>rating
          form on each help topic? Or, set up a method of ensuring that customers or service

          realize that your customers may not know all of the features that a wiki could give them,
          such as notifications on content changes. </p>

              >content<indexterm>single-sourcing</indexterm></indexterm>content to many different
          formats—has been a popular documentation method for many years now. Many technical writers
          already write in a single-sourcing<indexterm>single-sourcing</indexterm> environment and
          wonder if a wiki is yet another output. I’d suggest different approaches for wiki as
          source and wiki as output, depending on the type of content and the community that you
          expect to contribute to the wiki. </p>
        <p>Wiki round tripping is the conversion from source to wiki and back. It may mean
          processing information files in XML or XHTML, generating output to a wiki in wikitext,
          collecting the changes on the wiki, and folding them back into the source files,
          effectively taking the content on a trip around from source to wiki to source. Here are
          some suggestions for methods that may work. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>True round tripping in a wiki is feasible, if you don’t mind edits coming through the
            wiki back into your source. This type of round trip essentially means that the wiki is a
            source of content. </li>
          <li>A round trip in which the wiki is the continual output would mean that every time you
            publish the single source, you publish to a wiki. In this type of round trip, the
            ability to view a revision history is essential for the wiki community to understand
            what changed after the “publishing round trip event” occurred.</li>
          <li>A round trip in which the wiki is static and published as-is to another format, such
            as a book or PDF<indexterm>PDF, as wiki output</indexterm>, is yet another model. </li>
          <li>You can populate a wiki with content that is written in an easy-to-use authoring
            system with which your writers are familiar. This method is an excellent way to get an
            active wiki up and running. However, if you intend for the wiki to be more than just a
            fancy <indexterm>help, online<indexterm>compared to wikis</indexterm></indexterm>help
            system with comments, and you want to allow for community edits, then your wiki becomes
            the source from that initial publishing point onward. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another idea in the wiki round tripping arena is using DITA<indexterm>DITA</indexterm> as
          an in-between authoring-source-and-wiki-storage mechanism. At <indexterm>IBM<indexterm
              >BlueBooks wiki</indexterm></indexterm>IBM, they have successfully converted
          unstructured FrameMaker chapters into DITA topics and then used XSLT to write to
            <indexterm>MediaWiki<indexterm>from FrameMaker to</indexterm></indexterm>MediaWiki for
          an internal wiki used by their 60,000 services personnel to document complex and specific
          configurations for optimal performance or for best practices. These special documents are
          called RedBooks, and the BlueBooks wiki uses RedBooks content to allow experts to
          collaborate with each other on revisions of existing content. DITA serves as a data
          conduit, allowing the information to flow into the wiki.</p>
        <p>Round tripping wiki content might be necessary only if you cannot adjust to the wiki as
          your authoring environment. You might have business reasons for protecting the content by
          strictly limiting authors, or you might be able to gain efficiencies or get a particular
          output by using an already-familiar authoring tool. </p>
        <p>Business cases for round tripping include the need to tap into an existing technical
          person already recognized in the field by allowing their wiki edits to return to the
          single-sourced content, the need for high-quality print output from a source other than
          the wiki, and the need to keep the tool “experts” within the non-wiki tool with which they
          are familiar. Other considerations include the volume of edits, the need for semantic
          markup, the amount of “workaround” documentation that might cause contention on an
          external wiki, and the audience itself. </p>

      <title>Single-sourcing in XML and repurposing the content</title>
      <body>
        <p>Wikis can be sourced from other files or document types, including XML schemas like
            DITA<indexterm>DITA</indexterm>. If you use single-sourced content to populate or seed a
          wiki initially, you may also consider round tripping the content. If you’re trying to make
          a help system that looks like a wiki, but you are not taking advantage of the
          collaborative and crowdsourcing<indexterm>crowdsourcing</indexterm> aspects of a wiki, you
          just have a help system on the web. Also, the source files from which you created the wiki
          become effectively dead content if you go to the wiki and never re-connect back to the
          source files.</p>
        <p>But there are content models that work well with a wiki as the published output from XML
          source. You can use the wiki as a deliverable, and use it not for editing but to collect
          end-user comments and offer notifications. </p>
        <p>You may have another wiki published from XML source where only consultants have editing
          capabilities. A few people would contribute to that type of wiki and edit the articles
          that are pre-seeded by an information development team. In a wiki for such a focused
          audience, technical debate about scenarios and implementations may occur. Any edits to
          wiki pages would be manageable to manually change in your XML source files. </p>
        <p>If your wiki becomes the single source, and you output <indexterm>wikis<indexterm>PDF
              output from</indexterm></indexterm>PDFs or <indexterm>wikislices</indexterm>wikislices
          from it, be aware that wiki syntax<indexterm>wikis<indexterm
            >syntax</indexterm></indexterm> is, for many, a step backwards to the days of manual
          markup and may not be as quick and efficient as today’s authoring tools. You may be
          limited to only the subset of HTML markup that the wiki allows, or you may have access to
          complex macros, but at the cost of having to learn the macro language for the wiki
          application and perhaps teach other users. </p>

      <title>Understanding wiki patterns and wiki structures</title>
      <body>
        <p>Wikipatterns.com is an extremely useful site to help you start <indexterm>wikis<indexterm
              >patterns</indexterm></indexterm>wiki writing or maintenance. The book of the same
          name gives insights into wiki adoption and offers valuable case studies. Wiki patterns and
          other design patterns originate conceptually from architecture patterns. For example, an
          entryway pattern, be it arched tile, cobblestone, or a simple wooden gate with a dirt
          floor, offers a solution to the problem or question at hand, which is, “How do I enter
          this structure?” For a wiki, a comparison to an entryway pattern might be the welcoming
          pattern, where a current wiki contributor leaves a note on a new wiki contributor’s
            “<indexterm>wikis<indexterm>talk pages</indexterm></indexterm>talk” page or drops them a
          welcoming email after their first edit.</p>
        <p>Wiki patterns help you understand the people patterns and adoption patterns for the wiki.
          One adoption anti-pattern is Too much structure.<fn>
            <p> http://wikipatterns.com/display/wikipatterns/Too+much+structure</p>
          </fn> When you overload a wiki with strict guidelines or lots of empty pages, trying to
          get people to contribute, you may notice that the wiki does not grow organically like you
          hoped. In Wikipatterns, Stewart Mader suggests, “A wiki will evolve into the optimal
          organization of information as people use it, and it’s better to adjust the structure
          based on the content, instead of the other way around.” If a wiki is meant to be a content
          deliverable, strict hierarchy may work just fine to help readers find content. But a wiki
          that you expect to have contributions to should have the flexibility to grow as the
          community sees fit. </p>

      <title>Inheriting or maintaining a large wiki</title>
      <body>
        <p>Some wikis are already in place and in a certain state by the time you are introduced to
          them. How can you begin work on a large wiki, and what are some areas where you can help
          by contributing to wiki content?</p>
        <p>With the <indexterm>One Laptop per Child<indexterm>wiki</indexterm></indexterm>OLPC wiki,
          an individual contributor, David <indexterm>Farning, David</indexterm>Farning, went
          through the wiki and found the following categories. It’s an accurate content analysis
          based on my experience with the wiki. It was impressive and also helped explain my initial
          bewilderment at how to wrap my arms around the entire wiki.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Philosophy</li>
          <li>Contributing</li>
          <li>Creating</li>
          <li>Curating</li>
          <li>Projects</li>
          <li>Deliverable</li>
          <li>In progress</li>
          <li>Ideas</li>
          <li>Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the volunteer came up with these categories, he asked SJ <indexterm>Klein,
            SJ</indexterm>Klein, director of community content<indexterm>community-generated
              content<indexterm>contributions to</indexterm></indexterm> and long-time Wikipedian,
          if he thought the wiki needed structure. SJ Klein said that a wiki is purposefully without
          hierarchy (flat), especially for projects, to not force a parent or sibling sense for
          projects. He also said, however, that if you have a specific tree hierarchy in mind, feel
          free to develop the idea in some temporary space. So, when you are working on a large
          wiki, if you have some good ideas about organization, set them up and then ask for
          community feedback. </p>
        <p>Here are a few more ideas for starting out in a large wiki environment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Although the task might seem similar to starting a large writing project, I have found
            that wiki editing has some subtle differences because of the collaboration and community
            “vibe” already present behind the pages. You have to work to figure out that vibe, and
            then determine your course. New people must get a feel for the community so that they
            can figure out who they might irritate or please by editing a topic and whether they
            have the confidence to provide correct content.</li>
          <li>Figure out your role within the wiki community. It might take a while for you to get
            to know who’s there, what <i>their</i> roles are, and where you might best fit in.
            Introduce yourself with your profile<indexterm>profile, online</indexterm> page,
            following the wiki pattern, <indexterm>MySpace<indexterm>wiki
              pattern</indexterm></indexterm>MySpace.<fn>
              <p> http://www.wikipatterns.com/display/wikipatterns/MySpace</p>
            </fn></li>
          <li>Just like a newbie on a writing team, find out if there’s some “grunt work” that you
            can do to get your feet wet and to gain the community’s trust.</li>
          <li>Deletions in a wiki can incur some wrath, so they seem risky to do when you are
            starting out. If you do think some content should be deleted, contact the original
            author or the big contributors and ask whether you can mark it for deletion. Then, mark
            it and hope that someone else (a wiki administrator) determines that it should be
            deleted.</li>
          <li>Start small by <indexterm>tagging<indexterm>wiki
            content</indexterm></indexterm>tagging or applying templates. Those tasks help you get a
            feel for the bigger picture.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to coach others who come to your <indexterm>wikis<indexterm>collaboration
              in</indexterm></indexterm>wiki looking to do editing, you might look at the
          Mozillazine Knowledge Base’s guidelines on their About page.<fn>
            <p> http://kb.mozillazine.org/MozillaZine_Knowledge_Base:About</p>
          </fn> For writers who want to come in and “make big changes,” their wiki states “If you
          want to propose changes that affect a number of articles, for example a new categorization
          system or a generally reformatting of a class of articles, you should make your suggestion
          at [the wiki page] Knowledge Base changes. Doing so will give other editors and chance to
          give their opinions on the proposal. Even if you don’t think your change will be
          implemented, we’re still interested in hearing your opinions.”<fn>
            <p> http://kb.mozillazine.org/Knowledge_Base_changes</p>
          </fn> I appreciate this informative and welcoming statement because it helps contributors
          understand the way to approach their large wiki and its community members.</p>

      <p>Interview about wikis for technical documentation with Dee Elling of Embarcadero</p>
      <p><i>July 26th, 2007 </i></p>
      <p><ph>Anne</ph>: What are some of the factors for selecting a wiki software package?</p>
      <p><ph>Dee</ph>: <i>I’ve encountered hesitation from some writers about using a markup
          interface. Many writers preferred a Word-like GUI interface, such as
          Confluence</i><indexterm>Confluence</indexterm><i> provides. Another consideration is
          cost, since there is not always a budget for new systems; at CodeGear we use
          </i><indexterm>MediaWiki<indexterm>at CodeGear</indexterm></indexterm><i>MediaWiki.
          Primarily we manage internal information such as schedules and doc plans; lately we are
          collaborating with engineers to write FAQs and release notes.</i></p>
      <p><i>At my previous employer, one engineering team was writing the documentation themselves
          on the wiki (using outlines provided by the writer), and the writer cleaned it up and
          converted it to PDF</i><indexterm>PDF, as wiki output</indexterm><i> for distribution with
          the product. That is a great use case which I believe could seed the
          adoption</i><indexterm>adopting wikis in documentation process</indexterm><i> of wikis
          into the documentation process, especially in companies where there are limited doc
          resources.</i></p>
      <p><i>At CodeGear I can post copyrighted material to our Developer Network. The Developer
          Network technology allows comments on postings, which is not the same as wiki but a good
          start. Since joining, I have started to post traditional doc content as “articles” there.
          I’ve already fixed a few doc issues due to rapid customer feedback! We are also working on
          a design to make the website interface more wiki-like.</i></p>
      <p><ph>Anne</ph>: How do you get legal approval for such an open-edit site?</p>
      <p><ph>Dee</ph>: <i>At my previous company I never got to the stage of implementing a public
          wiki. However I had many discussions about the legal aspects related to the product
          documentation. The legal aspects seem complex, but lawyers can write new terms for new
          situations.</i></p>
      <p><i>At CodeGear the issue will involve intellectual property, but the user base is so active
          on the internet that there are few “secrets”. More important will be the issue of
          releasing information too soon or otherwise getting in trouble with SOX compliance. (That
          makes my head spin!)</i></p>
      <p><ph>Anne</ph>: What are the considerations when choosing where the wiki is hosted?</p>
      <p><ph>Dee</ph>: <i>Cost and reliability are factors, but most important is buy-in from the IT
          department, who would likely manage the hosting.</i></p>
      <p><ph>Anne</ph>: Which types of products are best targeted for a wiki?</p>
      <p><ph>Dee</ph>: <i>Complex software products are a good example. There is so much flexibility
          in software and product documentation cannot cover every use case. The wiki lets
          </i><indexterm>collaboration<indexterm>with customers</indexterm></indexterm><i>customers
          add content that is relevant to their own use cases, and that will benefit others.</i></p>
      <p><ph>Anne</ph>: How can you encourage your users to contribute?</p>

      <p><ph>Anne</ph>: What traps should be avoided?</p>
      <p><ph>Dee</ph>: <i>The trap of not responding or not paying attention. Writers must
          diligently track the “living documents” they have created, and they must truly
          collaborate. If customers contribute and their contributions go unrecognized, they may

      <p><i>Public wiki documentation must be actively managed and that takes more writer effort
          than in the past, when documents were forgotten as soon as they went to manufacturing.
          Contrary to the fear that with wikis you don’t need writers anymore, I believe that with
          wikis the role of the writer will grow.</i></p>

        <p>In 2006, eBay created a <indexterm>wikis, examples<indexterm
          >eBay</indexterm></indexterm>wiki (see ) so that sellers could help other sellers and to
          cut down on customer support calls.<fn>
            <p> http://www.forbes.com/markets/2006/06/14/ebay-0614markets04.html</p>
          </fn> This wiki should have worked well for many reasons. First of all, sellers are
          already trying to promote themselves and their stores, so contributing content helps them
          stand out in the crowded marketplace. Also, because a grading system is already motivating
          sellers, they are accustomed to online rating systems that also motivate them to continue
          and enhance their wiki contributions. However, eBay discontinued support for the wiki and
          now hosts it at ebaywiki.jot.com. No active contributions are sought, and the wiki
          articles are only retrievable, not writeable.</p>

      <p>While organizing the content and picking the right tool are important, there are many other
        implications when using a wiki for information delivery. Understand that the 90-9-1 rule
        means you will have a small club of one-percenters, and that one-percenter may be you. The
        community built around the wiki is as important or more important than the tool used to
        build the wiki. Because wikis are not like traditional documentation, strict style guidance
        and strict hierarchies may not work for the community that embraces the wiki. </p>

      in their fifties, and I have many friends at university. It keeps one young, and up with the
      vocabulary. That’s terribly important, especially for a writer. <br/>—Mary Wesley</epigram><p>Before you begin learning about the social web or trying it out for yourself, you may become
      overwhelmed just by the vocabulary. This book offers a sampling of some of the terms that you
      might come across. While this chapter offers some definitions, you also need to realize that
      the meanings change and morph, and often you will have to search the Internet or ask a
      colleague or friend for their definition before coming to your own conclusion about a new term
      and whether it is useful to keep in your vocabulary. Beware of trendy but meaningless terms,
      and be choosy about your definitions. </p><p>This chapter contains a frozen-in-time list of
      some terms and tools in 2009 that are related to social media. It isn’t easy to define every
      term, and often the best way to learn a definition for one of these terms is to try the
      concept for yourself to get a sense of what it is all about. Or, ask someone who uses these
      tools often for their favorite use cases. Even those items that do not currently seem to fit
      your business goals may someday be applicable in another situation. </p></body></chapter>

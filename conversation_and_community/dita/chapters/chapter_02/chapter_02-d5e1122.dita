          </fn> Sarah Maddox talks about answering Instant Messages from all around the world and
          being available to others to assist or just share humorous stories. Just be sure to have a
          sense of when to be unavailable, or keep “office hours” if the instant messaging
          communication devices become too disruptive for you to get your work done. </p><p>Online forums and mailing lists</p><p>In a <indexterm>forums<indexterm>participating in</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>conversations<indexterm>forums</indexterm></indexterm>forum, people can post
          questions about a product in hopes of getting answers quickly. Many open source products
          use forums as their sole support mechanism. Forums allow anyone to respond to a post or
          write a post. Complex forum software allows for HTML editing and emoticons in the text or
          signatures and has fully-featured notification and moderation systems. Community features
          include rating systems for each post or reply, avatars or profiles representing an online
          identity, private messaging, and even an indication of which users are currently online so
          people can talk with one another. You can use forummatrix.org to compare the features
          available in different forum software offerings.</p><p>Many forums use point systems or other methods for earning ranks, company t-shirts, or
          even a registration to a user conference. In some systems, you can vote on the helpfulness
          of an answer or thank another forum member for helping you. Cory Doctorow<indexterm>Doctorow, Cory</indexterm>‘s science fiction book, <i>Down and Out in the Magic
            Kingdom</i> contains a concept called <indexterm>whuffie</indexterm>whuffie—a
          reputation-based currency that emerges after all of society’s other needs are met for
          free. <indexterm>Hunt, Tara</indexterm>Tara Hunt<indexterm>Tara Hunt</indexterm> has a
          book called <i>The </i><indexterm>Whuffie Factor, The</indexterm><i>Whuffie Factor</i>,
          about the idea of whuffie to build online communities for business improvement. There are
          others building systems for online community reputation building. Yahoo Developer Network
          contains a library of design patterns for reputation solutions.<fn>

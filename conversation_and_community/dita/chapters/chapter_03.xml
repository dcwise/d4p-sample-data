    <p>As a writer, you need to find the correct value proposition for your work and determine
      whether your role is an enabler of conversation or an instigator of conversation. In a world
      of rock star coders, you want to find out whether you are a sage on stage or a stage hand. Or
      perhaps your evaluation will determine that no social media action is the correct action.</p>
    <p>You might already be aware of the challenges of introducing Web 2.0 or community-driven
      content in an enterprise environment. Many people are skeptics, asking for proof of the
      efficacy of the methods. This chapter discusses strategies for determining your role and
      offers strategies for a phased approach to integrating the social web in your writing. </p>

    <title>Challenges and opportunities</title>
    <body>
      <p>Once you get enthusiastic about a particular social networking tool or medium, you may find
        that you spend an inordinate amount of time on the site or reviewing the tools used for the
        site. Be aware of your priorities, and be cautious of portraying a tool as a time-wasting,
        productivity-sucking black hole before others can give it a chance. Remember that your
        online <indexterm>presence, online</indexterm>presence records the amount of time and the
        time of day that you work with a tool. You can avoid too much of a good thing if you’re
        smart about your time allocation. You might need to participate in an online community after
        normal business hours to ensure that the community trusts you to do your “real” job first
        and experimentation second.</p>
      <p>It’s important to find a balance between allowing an individual’s authentic voice to speak
        on behalf of an organization and the requirements of institutional messaging and <indexterm
            >brands<indexterm>preserving</indexterm></indexterm>brand preservation. Be sure to
        follow all related corporate <indexterm>policies, social computing<indexterm
            >following</indexterm></indexterm>policies and study the messaging that your company
        prefers to maintain. </p>
      <p>It’s also possible that you are ahead of the curve and need to help others see ways to
        apply social technologies for the company. You could get involved in a community related to
        personal interests outside of work to understand how social technologies can be applied
        before attempting to apply what you’ve learned at work. This approach works well especially
        if your organization is extra-conservative or if there is no demand for content with social
        connections yet for your company.</p>
      <p>What about the ubiquitous argument, “Sorry, but we just don’t have the resources for this
        type of project”? You might need to barter for resources or entice someone’s time and skills
        off the clock. Think of the reasons that people are motivated to contribute to a project,
        such as recognition or respect, and see what you can offer in return. Also realize that if
        the resources truly are not available but you think you can save time and money with social
        or community content<indexterm>community-generated content<indexterm>contributions
            to</indexterm></indexterm>, you need to have a strategy and be able to prove return on
        the investment in time and money. </p>

            >content development</indexterm></indexterm> is notoriously hard to measure because of

      <title>Taking stock of current communities and conversations</title>
      <body>
        <p>Before you jump in and risk embarrassing yourself or your team or, worse yet, angering
          customers or internal departments, with the absolute worst risk of being fired, you need
          to analyze and understand the <indexterm>communities<indexterm>writer's role
              in</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>communities<indexterm>existing</indexterm></indexterm>communities
          that already exist within your company or externally and learn how to interact or stand
          back. As writers, we need to figure out whether we would be welcomed as members of the
          community or whether we should instead try to enable the conversation through our
          deliverables. Based on the size of your particular community base, you may decide to
          immerse yourself in the <indexterm>communities<indexterm>participation
            in</indexterm></indexterm>community, to become a part of the conversation, and make your
          customers feel like you are helping them solve problems. </p>
        <p>Realize that there are <indexterm>grassroots communities for
            products</indexterm>grassroots<indexterm>grassroots efforts</indexterm>
          <indexterm>communities<indexterm>grassroots</indexterm></indexterm>communities related to
          commercial products. For example, the XMFan site<fn>
            <p> http://xmfan.com/</p>
          </fn> was started by regular people who are fans of XM Radio. Another example is the
            IKEAFans<fn>
            <p> http://ikeafans.com/</p>
          </fn> site offers support help and an “IKEApedia” area with assembly manuals included.
          When approaching a <indexterm>conversations<indexterm
          >enabling</indexterm></indexterm>community started outside of the company, though, be
          cautious of whether you would be considered an intruder or outsider. </p>
        <p>An excellent example of a writer offering their community involvement back with
          improvements to content is the lead writer for Adobe InDesign and InCopy products, Bob
            <indexterm>Bringhurst, Bob</indexterm>Bringhurst. He writes a blog at
          blogs.adobe.com/indesigndocs/ with announcements, buried treasures, and bonus
          documentation, to name a few categories. He is active on the user forums and uses his blog
          to talk to community members and link to others’ blogs, such as this InDesign link round
          up entry.<fn>
            <p> http://blogs.adobe.com/indesigndocs/2009/05/best_indesign_links_of_may.html</p>
          </fn></p>
        <p>You could follow different models for participation in communities—use the technical
          writer as personality and deliverer of content, a “sage on stage” model where the writer
          instigates participation opportunities, or involve the technical writer as a bystander of
          the conversation. In the second model, the writer is more like a stage hand who needs to
          understand the inner workings of the community theater to put on a good show. We can
          enable conversation through our user assistance without being the star of the show. A
          third model of participation is to listen to many communities and learn from the
          interactions of others, bringing that knowledge back into the technical documentation or
          passing it to the appropriate groups at your company. </p>
        <p>Anne Zelenka<indexterm>Zelenka, Anne</indexterm> has written about the <i>information
            age</i> versus the <indexterm>connectivity age</indexterm><i>connectivity age</i> on the
          Web Worker Daily<indexterm>Web Worker Daily</indexterm> web site.<fn>
            <p> http://gigaom.com/2007/10/06/from-the-information-age-to-the-connected-age/</p>
          </fn> I believe this distinction is an important one for the participation models that
          writers can choose. Are you an information worker or a connection worker, and does your
          corporate culture support you more in one model or another? Anne likens the building of
            Microsoft<indexterm>Microsoft<indexterm>"information age"
            example</indexterm></indexterm> as an example of the information age. The currency is
          always monetary, and the information that Microsoft created begat monolithic software.
          Google, on the other hand, has built a <indexterm>Google<indexterm>business
              model</indexterm></indexterm>business model based on human behavior to make products
          that use attention, such as Adwords, turn into monetized goods. If you can find a way to
          turn attention to your online help with <indexterm>conversations<indexterm
              >locating</indexterm></indexterm>conversation or community inclusion, you have moved
          your user assistance into the connected age. Take note of where your company already
          exhibits movement towards the connected age. </p>
        <p>If you have observed that most user <indexterm>communities<indexterm>content contributed
              by</indexterm></indexterm>communities do not publish comprehensive tomes, you are
          correct. As Andy Oram<indexterm>Oram, Andy</indexterm> of O’Reilly Media says, people who
          respond to email <indexterm>mailing lists<indexterm>community-based
            content</indexterm></indexterm>lists do not even think that they are writing
            documentation.<fn>
            <p> http://www.oreillynet.com/onlamp/blog/2007/01/why_do_you_contribute_to_commu.html
            </p>
          </fn> However, because a search can find the information, and the information can answer
          someone’s question later, it actually is documentation. As Darren Barefoot<indexterm
            >Barefoot, Darren</indexterm> said in his talk “Everyone’s a technical writer” at
            <indexterm>DocTrain West conference</indexterm>DocTrain West in spring 2008, the “people
          formerly known as the audience” are already documenting your products in ways you could
          never hope to cover yourself with a team of technical writers.</p>

      <title>Instigator or enabler of conversation</title>
      <body>
        <p>An <indexterm>technical documentation<indexterm>integrating with community-based
              content</indexterm></indexterm>instigator provides a starting point for a <indexterm
              >conversations<indexterm>instigating</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm
              >conversations<indexterm>enabling</indexterm></indexterm>conversation, perhaps by
          communicating a controversial decision or a highly debated strategic choice. A writer in
          an instigator role should know customers’ business needs and be well-connected with those
          he or she plans to talk to online. </p>
        <p>An enabler of conversation understands the underlying concepts of a product or service
          well enough to help others understand those concepts as well. An enabler gives a community
          the authority to make decisions or provides patterns that help a community develop and
          grow. </p>
        <p>Whether you’re an instigator or enabler, you can repeatedly gather knowledge from
            <indexterm>technical documentation<indexterm>benefiting from
            conversation</indexterm></indexterm>communities and conversation, then bring it back and
          incorporate what you’ve learned into the documentation. Ideally you’ll “give back” to the
            <indexterm>content<indexterm>community-generated</indexterm></indexterm>communities that
          provided the knowledge to you by continually improving the content offerings. </p>
        <p>It may seem that an extrovert would be the instigator of conversations in documentation,
          and an introvert would be the enabler of the conversations. Introversion and extroversion
          refer to how a person draws energy—either from an external source such as interaction with
          other people, or from an internal source, such as their own thoughts and imagination.
          However, in the realm of social media, introverts often find online social networking
          provides the right balance of encouragement to reach out along with the ability to turn
          off the stream of constant communication and regroup for a period of time. Therefore, the
          role of an instigator does not need to be reserved for an extrovert. An extroverted
          instigator may not be a good blogger, for example, because good writing often requires
          introspection and reflection. But either personality type can take on either role and do
          the tasks within each role. </p>

    <title>Building a strategic plan for conversation and community integration</title>
    <body>
      <p>As with all technical documentation projects, you should plan before implementing any
        changes to your documentation or approach. However, when trying out social media tools, you
        need to be willing to spend time experimenting. Grassroots<indexterm>grassroots
          efforts</indexterm> efforts that fly under management<indexterm>management
          buy-in</indexterm>’s radar for a while might give you the biggest payback. </p>
      <p>Beth Kanter<indexterm>Kanter, Beth</indexterm>, a social media consultant to non-profits,
        describes participation in social media as having five <indexterm>social media<indexterm
            >phases for implementing</indexterm></indexterm>phases: listen, participate, generate
        buzz, share content, and create community.<fn>
          <p> http://beth.typepad.com/beths_blog/2008/10/how-much-time-d.html</p>
        </fn> A simplification for our approach involves four phases: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, listen. </li>
        <li>Second, participate in the conversations (and continue to listen). </li>
        <li>Third, share content.</li>
        <li>Fourth, lead the way by offering a platform for conversations to occur.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A conversation enabler will work best in the first two phases. A conversation instigator
        can work in all the phases. I believe this phased approach yields better results than
        jumping straight to offering a platform. You may notice that I skipped over <indexterm
          >Kanter, Beth</indexterm>Beth Kanter’s third phase where she suggests that you should
        generate buzz. I don’t think that generating buzz or media attention is necessarily the
        realm of <indexterm>technical documentation<indexterm>integrating with community-based
            content</indexterm></indexterm>technical documentation, though it might be if you’re a
        lone writer bridging the gap in technical marketing documentation. </p>

      <title>Content sharing phase</title>
      <body>
        <p>The content sharing phase may be as simple to implement as adding a <indexterm>Creative
            Commons license</indexterm>Creative Commons <indexterm>content<indexterm
              >licensing</indexterm></indexterm>license to your content to allow for share and share
          alike. Licensing your content with a Creating Commons license declares that your content
          is reusable and describes the conditions and circumstances for that reuse. There are
          different licenses available for you (or your legal department at your company) to review.
          Instead of reserving all rights to your documentation, you reserve some rights, but also
          free the content to be used by others. For example, the Adobe help content offered with
          the Technical Communication Suite has a Creative Commons license, Attribution
          Non-Commercial Share Alike, as indicated by this icon:</p>
        <p>On the creativecommons.org web site, you can answer straight forward questions to
          determine the license you want for your content, such as do you want to allow commercial
          uses of your work, do you want to allow modifications of your work (with or without others
          share alike on content created from your work), and the jurisdiction of your license.
          Licensing your content lets you share your content. </p>
        <p>Another way to share your content is to offer an RSS feed that someone could embed in a
          sidebar or another location in a web page. A web service like dapper.net can help you make
          RSS feeds from any web page. </p>
        <p>You can share content by uploading photos or screenshots to a <indexterm
            >photos</indexterm>photo sharing site such as Flickr, or you could upload videos or
            <indexterm>screencasts</indexterm>screencasts to You Tube or Vimeo. Beyond photos and

              source<indexterm>wikis for</indexterm></indexterm>wiki for providing drafts of
          documentation and delivering info quickly. Content on the wiki did not need to be perfect
          or in a strict template. Once a draft was posted to the wiki, writers then posted a
          message to the user forum to let them know they could review it. Once the content was
          reviewed and vetted, writers transferred it to the main website instead of the wiki. One
          lesson to learn from their experience is that even though the writers provided a platform
          for community content, the model that was most valuable was using the wiki for drafting
          content then transferring the content to a non-platform-based deliverable.</p>

        often, your users may expect documentation updates every release. A wiki may be the best way
        to fulfill this expectation. If the product releases only once every other year, you can
        invest in conversations during those longer release cycles by using a different format, such

        or conversing with customers. If you continue to deliver printed documentation, you will
        want to find online methods for enabling conversation and community. If you do not already

          networking or notifications technology would help solve those problems. Customers cannot

          Keep in mind that the terms “RSS feeds” and “wiki” may not be familiar to your customers.
          If you asked them, “Would you like to know when new items are added to the help system?”,
          they would probably respond positively. Also consider the prospect who is not yet a
          customer. What conversation or community techniques can build relationships that help with

      <title>Determining your role in the conversation</title>
      <body>
        <p>You can ask several questions to help discover if you are an enabler of conversation, an
          instigator, or both. Depending on the number of users of the products that you document,
          there may be a place for the technical writer in the <indexterm>communities<indexterm
              >participation in</indexterm></indexterm>community. For wiki documentation especially,
          it is important that you become a conversation starter, unless there’s a large community
          base already. Several factors influence<indexterm>influence, measuring</indexterm> this
          determination: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is the <indexterm>communities<indexterm>writer's role
            in</indexterm></indexterm>community small, and if so, can you easily become like the
            community members? Or is there a conflict of interest that might prevent you from direct
            communications? </li>
          <li>What <indexterm>communities<indexterm>motivations of</indexterm></indexterm>motivates
            the community to use your product? If community members are passionate about your
            product because they selected it, the conversation may be easy to start and continue. If
            the product was purchased by upper management and implemented by community members, you
            might be more effective as a conversation enabler than a starter/joiner. </li>
          <li>Is the community getting paid to implement the product? If so, will they view your
              presence<indexterm>presence, online</indexterm> as competition? In this type of
            situation, it might be better to enable conversation.</li>
          <li>Has another department in your company started a <indexterm>conversations<indexterm
                >instigating</indexterm></indexterm>conversation? If other departments internally
            are in fact responsible for responding, be careful about how your involvement might be
            interpreted. Talk to others internally before inserting yourself as a community member
            or you may appear to be strong-arming others. A slow, easy beginning is best, and
            practice and hands-on experience are your most valuable assets. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whether you’re enabling a conversation or are part of the conversation, it’s important to
          be professional but also personable and genuine. </p>
        <p>Also expect to face the inevitable negativity or conflict that can occur within a
          community. You should face it, communicate openly, overcome the negative discussions, and
          do not purposely avoid negative situations. </p>

          judgement in all their online interactions. </p>
        <p>Additionally, study your corporate culture to determine how much openness and
          transparency already exist. Look for areas where transparency and openness are rewarded

        <p>What development method does your team use? Agile development refers to a group of

          Agile team you use time-boxed iterations to deliver small features of potentially
          shippable software at the end of each iteration. Central to many Agile shops are Scrum
          project management and self-organizing teams with cross-functional team members, including
          technical writers embedded on development teams. The way software is developed usually

          adjust the publication release cycles, information development methods, and the amount of
          documentation that is promised with each release, depending on the staffing challenges

          a conversation, with daily team standup meetings and collaboration with team members on

      <p>For those who are interested in being a representative voice for your department, for the

        can use to begin <indexterm>conversations<indexterm
        >joining</indexterm></indexterm>conversations. Each team member should have a consistent,
        professional, and approachable online persona. Search for your first and last name on Google

        and external to your company.</p>
      <p>Examine existing community starting points for your customer base. Begin the conversations
        in a non-intimidating manner, such as commenting on blog posts. Always represent yourself
        honestly, and determine your standard disclaimer and when you will apply a disclaimer. For
        example, you need to identify yourself as a corporate representative when the blog post
        addresses a topic specific to your company.</p>
      <p>For some team members, nothing could be more terrifying than losing anonymity while writing
        technical documentation. Because identifying oneself online can have negative consequences,
        do not require this type of involvement as a term of employment for existing employees.
        Writers may want to maintain two personas online, a personal one and a professional one.
        Behind-the-scenes and connector roles do not require the loss of anonymity or privacy. And
        rather than being directly involved in the conversations, writers can facilitate
        conversations and community by incorporating them into the documentation system. </p>

        <p>It is very easy to stumble while practicing the art of conversation and community, so you

          any type of social media. This technology is still relatively experimental, and you should
          allow your team to experiment to find the strengths and weaknesses of a new delivery

    <title>Managing these conversational, connective, community methods</title>

      <p>As with the introduction of any new technology, you should ask yourself whether it is
        necessary? What criteria make this conversation-based implementation important at this point
        in the product’s lifecycle? How can you make it a priority? You need to be able to write a
        business case for the cost savings or time savings that could occur based on the
        conversation-based implementation that you are considering. Find out what business areas
        need the most work right now. Understand your department’s place in the organization—are you
        more helpful to marketing and pre-sales efforts or to technical support? Does your audience
        consist mostly of internal consultants, and if so, what are their biggest hurdles? How could
        conversation-based or community-based content help them meet their goals?</p>
      <p>Also consider that your manager has access to more information than you do and may
        understand the current customer climate and community better than you do. Without the

        <p>All questions about using <indexterm>social media<indexterm>time
            commitment</indexterm></indexterm>social media technologies distill to the single
          question, “How much time does all this take?” Beth Kanter has some ideas. She says that
          each rung of the ladder involves more and more time. Expect to allocate 5 hours a week to
          listen, 10 hours a week to participate, and 20 hours a week to provide a platform for
          sharing content. For community <indexterm>communities<indexterm
            >growing</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>communities<indexterm>building</indexterm></indexterm>building,
          expect the tasks to consume at least 25 hours of a team’s work week. You likely don’t need
          to add the listening hours to the participating hours once you are building a community,
          though if each of those tasks remains important and gives good return on the time spent,
          then the time adds up to sixty hours a week. These time estimates may add up so that you
          realize you need more than one person assigned to this type of effort. In short, these
          tasks can easily become a full time job. The size and growth rate of the community will
          also dictate the number of hours needed to address their needs. Compare the time needed to
          welcome two or three people to an online community per day to welcoming over one hundred
          new members each day. </p>

          can show the type of audience the blogger has gained. When you measure these factors,
          rephrase the Return on Investment (ROI) question as an investment in Influence. In your
          environment, how can you prove that Influence is worth investing in?</p>
        <p>After you have determined that time and resources should be invested in order to increase

      <title>Measuring whether a documentation conversation works </title>
      <body>
        <p>This question, “But does documentation as conversation work?” stems from the <indexterm
              >metrics<indexterm>social media implementation</indexterm></indexterm>measurability
          equation. Those who are interested in website metrics and analytics often want some fancy
          tool to take care of the measurements for them. But, in reality, it is extremely difficult
          to know what measuring stick you can use on a blog entry, for example, or the value of a
          well-stocked wiki. Measuring community involvement is often discussed in fuzzy vague terms
          and not hard numbers. So, if you apply conversation or community methods to <indexterm
            >technical documentation<indexterm>measuring effectiveness
          of</indexterm></indexterm>documentation, how do you prove it is working? And how do you
          prove the level to which it’s working and whether it outpaces conventional user assistance
          methods? </p>
        <p>Website analytical tools like <indexterm>metrics<indexterm>Google
            Analytics</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Google<indexterm>Analytics</indexterm></indexterm>Google
          Analytics help you count numbers of visitors, and the tools are getting more sophisticated
          about measuring how long each visitor stays. Also, they are better able to track the path
          that users take through a help system, which can help you measure their effectiveness.
          Plus, Google’s <indexterm>help, online<indexterm>tracking

              >keywords</indexterm></indexterm>keywords are most efficient for letting a user figure
          out the answer and move on. Time spent on a page may or may not be a good measurement for
          effectiveness of a help system, but findability<indexterm>findability</indexterm> of your
          help system is measurable. You can also ask your audience if their participation in
          conversation or community has prevented them from leaving a company or abandoning a
          product from a particular company. Often we don’t measure in the sense of preventing a
          negative result.</p>
        <p><indexterm>community equity</indexterm>Community equity is an emerging research area that
          measures the value that an individual brings as a member of an online community. Peter
          Reiser at Sun Microsystems has developed a method and algorithm for calculating a member’s
          community equity based on information offerings and personal interactions with others. His
          team also created widgets that help people see other members equity ratings and central
          areas of expertise. By reading, rating, contributing, tagging, and editing, a person
          increases their <indexterm>information equity</indexterm>information equity. Personal
          equity is calculated based on connections, reputation, and collaborative efforts. The
          values “age” and decrease to zero over time so there is a “freshness” to the values. Peter

          titled “20 Reasons Why Microsoft Loves Open Source.” Whurley’s blog entry it was intended
          to draw attention and managed to get on the front page of active online communities such
          as Slashdot and Digg. It could cost $800,000 dollars to gain similar media coverage. That
          is one method to measure conversations, though <indexterm>whurley (William

          competitors does not fit nicely into our usual methods of delivering quality information
          in a timely manner. </p>
        <p>So, how could you measure whether a technical publication-based conversation is working?
          My first suggestion is to go to the usual metrics that technical publication uses to
          provide value—for example, lowered support costs. Or, perhaps it is not Return on
          Investment you need to measure but <indexterm>risk of inaction (ROI)</indexterm><indexterm
              >metrics<indexterm>risk of inaction</indexterm></indexterm>Risk of Inaction. If your

              posts</indexterm></indexterm>comments and other conversation-based, community-based
          user assistance tools, your team should evaluate their use for your deliverables as well.
          Just as competing products need to keep up with each other’s features, I think that we
          need to keep an eye on competitor’s conversations and determine if there’s a perceived
          value your company should match.</p>

          done, find a way to tap into that community base. If your documentation is a sales-winning

          negative distractions. But brand protection, public relations, and crisis communications
          are likely better left to a professional trained in those areas, and you should find
          someone at your company who can help in those areas. You should also be ready to escalate

      <title>Grassroots efforts</title>
      <body>
        <p>Grassroots efforts are defined by an unofficial group starting a project without
          authority or hierarchy but with organic growth and natural networking tendencies. When a
          few friends or coworkers who share a common vision or goal start on an effort that grows
          beyond their expectations, that would be a grassroots<indexterm>grassroots
            efforts</indexterm> effort. </p>
        <p>Another term that is used rather than grassroots<indexterm>grassroots efforts</indexterm>
          is <indexterm>groundswell</indexterm>groundswell, from the book by the same name. In this
          context, a groundswell is “a social trend in which people use technologies to get the
          things they need from each other rather than from traditional institutions like
          corporations.” It is also described more simply as a change in public opinion that is
          broad and far-reaching. Writers can build a groundswell because they know the product
          well, can help people make connections with each other with social technologies, and can
          write well enough to convince others of the basic value of the product. Writers may also
          already know community members who might be willing to help with a few tasks, or at least
          be willing to review write-ups. With a publishing platform like a blog or a wiki, writers
          enable conversations to take place that may not have had a place to occur.</p>
        <p>Writers at a mobile phone designer and manufacturer who wanted to experiment with a wiki
          decided to go through the correct channels for a legal disclaimer by simply requesting
          revisions to the legal verbiage in their existing online help disclaimer. They were
          pleasantly surprised when their legal department was helpful and encouraged their
          experiment. Then the writers created a <indexterm>MediaWiki<indexterm>at mobile phone
              manufacturer</indexterm></indexterm>MediaWiki installation, pre-seeded it with content
          from their user guide, and waited to see if users would find it and edit it. </p>
        <p>Interestingly, a few years after this experimental wiki, it turns out, another wiki built
          by end-users of the cell phone they intended to document and build a community around,
          became “the” source for information and user-to-user communication about the phone and
          tips and tricks. In that case, while the company wiki was helpful, the external community
          wiki was more visited and edited. I think their experiment showed their relative naivete
          about the power of community building rather than web page building.</p>
        <p>Another term related to grassroots is astroturf, which is a group that wants to be known
          as grassroots but is conceived, created, and sometimes funded by a corporation or lobby.
          Full disclosure of the backing behind your efforts is the best course of action to avoid
          distrust or suspicion later when someone reveals the origin of the group and the
          underlying motivations. </p>

    <epigram>The scale of the global community that is going to be able to participate in all sorts
      of discovery and innovation is something that the world has simply never seen before.<br
      />—Thomas Friedman, The World is Flat</epigram>
    <p>This chapter explores the idea that a small group of people who have a sense of belonging in
      an online community may provide content much like a technical writer does. Regardless of their
      background, education, or training, more people are becoming providers of technical
      information on the web. The gift economy, where altruism motivates contributions more than
      monetary gain, is partially responsible for this shift. <indexterm>Anderson,
      Chris</indexterm>Chris Anderson, author of <i>The Long Tail</i>, also wrote the article,
      “Free! Why $0.00 Is the Future of Business” for Wired<indexterm>Wired</indexterm> magazine<fn>
        <p> http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-03/ff_free?currentPage=all</p>
      </fn> in February of 2008. In the article he describes a taxonomy<indexterm
        >taxonomy</indexterm> of “free” that contains many models including the gift economy. In <i
        >Naked Conversations</i>, bloggers <indexterm>Scobel, Robert</indexterm>Robert Scobel and
        <indexterm>Israel, Shel</indexterm>Shel Israel state “Altruism turns people on even more
      than making money.” Combine these altruistic motivations with a publishing system that has a
      low barrier to entry and you get a whole new way of working and writing. </p>
    <p>If anyone can be a writer, what communities of writers have formed, and what have they
      accomplished? Why would you leverage someone’s sense of community belonging for documentation
      instead of hiring professional writers? How do you form communities online and in the real
      world? </p>
    <p><indexterm>communities<indexterm>definition of</indexterm></indexterm><i>Community</i> has
      many definitions, but an <i>online community</i> has specific elements that shape its
      definition. From a blog entry by Forrester Research analyst Jeremiah <indexterm>Owyang,
        Jeremiah</indexterm>Owyang comes this definition: “An online community is: Where a group of
      people with similar goals or interests connect and exchange information using web tools.”<fn>
        <p> http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2007/12/28/defining-the-term-community/</p>
      </fn> As you might expect from a community researcher, Owyang says that his Twitter followers
      helped him shape that definition. Howard <indexterm>Rheingold, Howard</indexterm>Rheingold
      defines a virtual <indexterm>communities<indexterm
        >virtual</indexterm></indexterm>community<indexterm>virtual communities</indexterm> in his
      book, <i>The Virtual Community</i>, as “when people carry on public discussions long enough,
      with sufficient human feeling, to form webs of personal relationships.” Think of the online
      communities you belong to. You know there are common elements of discussion, agreement, core
      values, and unifying goals that help you identify it as a community. Relationships are the
      makeup of communities. Connections with each other establish relationships. Not all
      relationships in a community have to be positive­—even contentious debate can help a community
      meet its goals as long as the relationships remain respectful and intact after
      discussions.</p>
    <p>Although in-person <indexterm>collaboration<indexterm
      >in-person</indexterm></indexterm>collaboration is an aspect of communities and documentation,
      much communication happens only online until community members meet at a conference or a
      networking event. Much of the communication that helps you feel like you know a person in the
      community happens online long before a face-to-face meeting. It’s that in-person or online
      conversation and public discourse that forges the relationships that create a community. </p>
    <p>Sometimes the tools that help create the connections are mistaken for the community itself.
      Community is built from the connections, not the tools. For example, a blog with <indexterm
          >comments<indexterm>on blog posts</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>comments<indexterm>on
          blog posts</indexterm></indexterm>comments might constitute a conversation, but it does
      not constitute the community itself. This distinction is important for a few reasons. First,
      it can help you choose which tools you can use to form a community. Second, it can help you
      understand why you might not have a community on your hands, yet, even though the right tools
      are in place. And, it can help you understand why a wiki has few edits yet many hits. Perhaps
      the sense of belonging to a community with a specific purpose and set of goals and the
      motivations that follow are not yet present. Or perhaps the technology layers are not
      familiar, so people don’t feel comfortable in an online community until they make sense of the
      tools for communication and interaction. </p>

    <title>Motivations for writers and online communities</title>
    <body>
      <p>Why are any of us interested in documenting a complex product or process? It’s possible
        that the core of our motivation is recognition or reward, measured in terms of money or
        success. Or maybe we think that writing and communicating with text, images, audio, or video
        is a great way to make a living. But, an underlying motivator for many technical writers is
        the desire to help others learn. By teaching, you learn twice. By joining a community, being
        a community member, and looking for places where you can either contribute or motivate
        others to contribute, you are empowering <indexterm>collaboration<indexterm>with
            audiences</indexterm></indexterm>collaborative efforts unlike any seen in the past. What
        I am observing more is that community members who do not have a writing role still want to
        write or communicate information about the product or service.</p>
      <p>I can identify with the desire to help people through my work with the One Laptop per Child
          project<indexterm>One Laptop per Child<indexterm>author's experience
          with</indexterm></indexterm>. My kids and the kids in my son’s preschool classroom
        inspired me to work for the first time on an open source project. My first experience with
        Sugar, the open source operating system for the laptop, was an emulation on my laptop, and I
        was floored by its elegance and simplicity, created by a community of developers and
        usability experts giving their time to the project. I was inspired by the high quality of
        their offering and wanted the documentation to match it.</p>
      <p>I have found my volunteer work to be invaluable as a learning experience and exercise in
        connecting to others. But I will also admit that one of my motivations has been to
        experiment with publishing and book promotion, with an idea in the back of my head that
        FLOSS Manuals could hit upon a huge bestselling book idea. </p>
      <p>Before the OLPC Book Sprint in August, the FLOSS Manuals community had quite a nice
        discussion about money and free documentation. Income from book sales is typically used to
        further fund <indexterm>FLOSS Manuals<indexterm>goals</indexterm></indexterm>FLOSS Manuals’
        goals as a non-profit community—invest your gains to further your aims.</p>
      <p>So while writers are accustomed to earning money directly for writing, they might find that
        they are motivated not by the money itself but by the additional activities the money can
        fund. For example, profits from a Book Sprint can be used to fund future Book Sprints.</p>
    </body>
    <subsection
      id="d5e119">
      <title>New roles for writers</title>
      <body>
        <p>One of the roles I learned about while writing for a wiki is “<indexterm>manager,
            community</indexterm><indexterm>community manager</indexterm><indexterm
              >communities<indexterm>managing</indexterm></indexterm>community manager.” In many
          wiki environments, the writer can be the “content <indexterm>content<indexterm>curators
              of</indexterm></indexterm>curator,” someone who assembles collections based on themes.
          But if your goal is to build and grow a wiki, you need to build and grow the community for
          it first. People who feel they are part of a community may share knowledge as the
          community becomes a <indexterm>communities<indexterm>of
          practice</indexterm></indexterm>community of practice. Clay <indexterm>Shirky,
            Clay</indexterm>Shirky, in his talk about his book, <i>Here Comes Everybody</i>,<fn>
            <p> http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/interactive/events/2008/02/shirky</p>
          </fn> explains how quickly a community of practice can form now that online tools speed up
          the process of teaching specific techniques and learning them from others. A community of
          practice uses people as conduits to transfer knowledge. As those who study knowledge
          management have learned, workers spend a third of their time searching for information,
          and workers are five times more likely to turn to experienced co-workers for information
          rather than reading a book, thereby shortening their learning curve and hopefully avoiding
          mistakes. </p>
        <p>You have probably heard of the phrase “train the trainer.” You may even imagine that your
          role as a writer is to write to the person who reads enough to learn a product inside and
          out and become the in-house expert for it. As an extension of that writer’s role of
          training the trainer, a writer may become a leader within the online <indexterm
              >communities<indexterm>writer's role in</indexterm></indexterm>community, teaching
          other community members. This trainer role may be highly motivating to some.</p>
        <p>Particular types of users are more likely to seek out online <indexterm
              >communities<indexterm>participation in</indexterm></indexterm>communities for
          information—competent performers, proficient performers, and expert performers, as defined
          by Dreyfus and Dreyfus in <i>Mind over Machine</i>. In their “Model of Skill Acquisition,”
          these types of users are separated from the novices and advanced beginners, who represent
          the first two stages in the model. Advanced users are more likely to demand useful
          examples, instructions for getting results or achieving a specific goal, and advanced
          troubleshooting information. </p>
        <p>When managing a community of experts, realize that the rules of the community can make
          entry difficult. Consider that some <indexterm>communities<indexterm
            >rules</indexterm></indexterm>communities have an unspoken “no whining” rule, which
          creates a very different atmosphere than a community that has a “there are no dumb
          questions” philosophy. </p>

      <title>Free as in freedom documentation</title>

        <p>Why do people contribute to documentation for no payment or even unknowingly, since they
          don’t consider themselves to be writers? Andy Oram<indexterm>Oram, Andy</indexterm>,
          senior editor at O’Reilly Media, studied contributions to documentation by surveying
          people who contribute to online forums, email <indexterm>mailing lists<indexterm

            <p>
              http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2007/06/14/why-do-people-write-free-documentation-results-of-a-survey.html?page=1</p>
          </fn> report contains many findings, some of which are surprising:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>People generally don’t think that they were contributing to documentation.</li>
          <li>People don’t think of themselves as writers, despite the fact that the communication
            is written.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Because the people surveyed were not paid directly for their written contributions, their
          contributions could be considered free as in “no-cost.” In <indexterm>open
              source<indexterm>open documentation contributions</indexterm></indexterm>open source
          circles, “free” can mean “freedom” rather than “no cost.” “Free” documentation, however,
          represents a shift away from these two definitions. </p>
        <p>The email/Internet/search engine infrastructure that is in place enables all of us to
          feel like we are getting and giving information for free. In reality, a small group of
          people who have computers and pay $40 per month for high speed Internet access offer their
          time and knowledge in information exchanges in the hope that they will be repaid by
          others’ time and knowledge, through recognition, by achieving a sense of belonging, or by
          gaining back time through efficiency gains. These <indexterm>communities<indexterm

          membership is a hands-on activity that you do best when you have practice at it. It is not
          easy to get experience, but it is necessary. You must read the online arguments (flame
          wars) and observe other’s reactions to know how to handle them better each time they
          happen. You can observe leadership passing hands and the delegation that occurs. But
          observation does not always teach you how to step into a leadership role or delegate
          well.</p>
        <p>You can learn the ebb and flow of a <indexterm>communities<indexterm>measuring
              conversations in</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>conversations<indexterm>measuring
              "social weather"</indexterm></indexterm>conversation and become a meteorologist for
          the “<indexterm>social weather</indexterm>social weather” that’s ongoing in a community.
          For an example of social weather, do what Clay <indexterm>Shirky, Clay</indexterm>Shirky
          writes in his description of the course with the same name at New York University. Simply
          make some observations next time you walk into a restaurant. Is it noisy or quiet? Slow or
          busy? Are there couples or groups dining? In a restaurant you have visual and auditory
          cues to give your inner meteorologist a chance to assess the social weather. In an online
          community, you need to understand the cues that occur in writing, in emoticons, and in
          frequency and intensity of updates to content. In the presentation “Blogs and the social
          weather” at the Internet Research 3.0 conference in October 2002, Alex Halavais describes
          a deep dive analysis of bloggers’ discourse.</p>
        <lq>
          <p><i> “By measuring changes in word frequency within a large set of popular blogs over a
              period of four weeks, and comparing these changes to those in the ‘traditional’ media
              represented on the web, we are able to come to a better understanding of the nature of
              the content found on these sites. This view is further refined by clustering those
              blogs that carry similar content. While those who blog may not be very representative
              of the public at large, charting discourse in this way presents an interesting new
              window on public opinion.” </i><indexterm>Halavais, Alan</indexterm><fn>

            </fn></p>
        </lq>
        <p>While this concept may sound new and exciting, it is quite 20th century. Analyzing
          newspaper content to determine public opinion was researcher A.A.<indexterm
              >blogs<indexterm>analyzing conversations in</indexterm></indexterm>Tenney’s original

        <p>So what are some ideas for keeping the <indexterm>social weather</indexterm>social
          weather sunny and clear in a community? <indexterm>Hunt, Tara</indexterm>Tara Hunt’s
          pillars of happiness are a good set of guidelines for testing your social deliverables for
          helping users and contributors. When community members can voice an opinion, give an
          honest review, and build an article or a diagram or a picture or a video, perhaps by
          taking on a writing role, they feel autonomous and happiness follows. Kathy Sierra calls
          creating competent users “helping users kick ass,” and she has written valuable blog
          entries about how to do that.<fn>
            <p> http://headrush.typepad.com/</p>
          </fn> In the area of relatedness, a writer doesn’t necessarily have to be a community
          member to enable people to talk to each other and meet in person more easily. Organizing
          tweetups (in-person gatherings for <indexterm>Twitter<indexterm
            >tweetups</indexterm></indexterm>Twitter users) or user group meetings are an extension
          of the community manager role, enabling people to feel related to one another.
          Documentation that enables relatedness, such as helping wiki writers talk to each other
          via comments or “<indexterm>wikis<indexterm>talk pages</indexterm></indexterm>talk” pages
          contributes to that pillar of happiness. </p>
        <p>I found that after moving OLPC content to the FLOSS Manuals wiki, I still communicated
          project information via the OLPC wiki at wiki.laptop.org. When I organized the Book
          Sprint, I used a particular request page on the wiki to invite community members to the
          event. Volunteers then contacted me through my wiki “Talk” page which sent an email
          notification to the email address I had designated while still keeping our discussion open
          for any project contributor to see. </p>

          Others may set a basic rule like: The only dumb question is the one unasked. These two
          communities will attract different members. Also, after you identify an established
          community you want to join, realize that it may take a direction that you hadn’t
          considered by changing its goals or changing some of its rules or culture. </p>
        <p>Rather than trying to single-handedly grow the community, delegate to and recruit from
          the established community members for tasks that are not in your area.</p>
        <p><indexterm>communities<indexterm>patterns</indexterm></indexterm>Communities may have
            <indexterm>wikis<indexterm>patterns</indexterm></indexterm>patterns and anti-patterns
          much like the wiki patterns that Stewart <indexterm>Mader, Stewart</indexterm>Mader
          identified in his book of the same name. In online communities, people can block progress
          on community projects such as coding open source software. For example, someone might
          offer to address a bug but then doesn’t. The lack of follow-through becomes a block for
          anyone else who wants to make progress on the bug. Lack of documentation can also hamper
          community efforts. Ever-changing or ambiguous licensing of code may cause a community to
          abandon it if the license is not easy to use or not in line with the community’s vision. </p>
        <p>Realize that benevolent dictatorship may not be the correct approach for a community. A
          benevolent dictatorship usually involves one leader who maintains a stance of always doing
          what’s best for the community, but maintains control over all decisions. Keep a balance as
          you foster community interaction, especially if you become a leader. Realize that everyone
          can have a role or several roles at once, both leading and following. </p>
        <p>Software management books author Gerald <indexterm>Weinberg, Gerald</indexterm>Weinberg
          once said, “No matter what the problem is, it’s always a people problem.” Remember that
          technology layers cannot fix basic <indexterm>communities<indexterm>trust
              within</indexterm></indexterm>trust issues or bad behavior. Rather than adding
          administration layers, complex access control lists, or even check-ins, talk through the
          people problems. And if you are the benevolent dictator, be ready to allow the community
          to self-govern if that is the right direction for it.</p>

        profession or to the tools needed for their job, or a community related to a fun
        recreational interest. It follows that people want to meet others in person at meetings and
        gatherings. These events not only enable you to communicate with your company’s customers;
        events help the customers meet and talk to each other. User groups and focus groups are
        examples of real-world meetings that have a single goal in mind. <indexterm

        and <indexterm>meetups</indexterm>meetups are another type of real-world event where people

          <indexterm>Book Sprint</indexterm>Book Sprint borrows from these camp concepts to create a
        one-week event of collaborative authoring that generates a book. </p>

      <body>
        <p>An unconference or <indexterm>conversations<indexterm
          >barcamp</indexterm></indexterm>barcamp is usually defined by its lack of definition. The
          morning of the event, attendees gather at one place in front of a white board or poster
          and offer to share their knowledge in presentations or demonstrations. The unconference
          has no agenda until session ideas are placed on a white board, often using Post-it notes,
          in certain time slots so that participants can find sessions to attend. Sometimes a wiki
          page can help shape the agenda before the event, but the board at the event is the “final”
          schedule. </p>
        <p>A meetup is a prearranged group meeting and the online social networking site meetup.com
          facilitates organizing those meetings. A combination of meetup and <indexterm
              >Twitter<indexterm>tweetups</indexterm></indexterm>Twitter, a Tweetup is an in-person
          meeting organized using Twitter for publicity and invites. Sometimes these events are
          intended for casual entertaining, other times they are organized for professional
          networking. The main point of these types of gatherings is to take advantage of the higher
          fidelity conversations that in-person events offer.</p>
        <p>How can you plan for such a purposely impromptu event such as an unconference? First you
          have to realize that the attendees are going to make or break the event. I had little
          experience with planning an unconference when I was asked to plan one that would take
          place during the 2008 DocTrain West conference. With the encouragement and help of one
          person who was certainly going to attend, I was able to grow the invitation list with
          like-minded individuals. We ended up with some of the most interesting attendees, and one
          person said it was the most useful session of the conference to him, a compliment
          considering that the unconference was embedded within a highly valuable conference with a
          devoted group of attendees.</p>

            documentation<indexterm>collaborative authoring</indexterm></indexterm>publishing a
        book. That sums up the goal of the Book Sprint as devised by Tomas Krag, whose interests lie
        in the use of technology for developing nations and who was much more interested in the
        distribution of content and ideas than protecting his rights as an author. <indexterm>Hyde,
          Adam</indexterm>Adam Hyde, founder of FLOSS Manuals, was keen to explore the idea of an
        extreme Book Sprint, which compresses the authoring and production of a print-ready book
        into a week-long sprint. The first year after the birth of the Book Sprint concept, Adam and
        FLOSS Manuals experimented with several models of the sprint.</p>
      <p>An entire Book Sprints book is available on the FLOSS Manuals website, offering how-to
        guidance for running your own Book Sprint. This section re-uses some of that content to
        spread the Book Sprint ideas and concepts as a collaboration technique. </p>

      <title>Book Sprint planning</title>
      <body>
        <p><indexterm>discussions about content<indexterm>in Book
          Sprints</indexterm></indexterm>Although the goal of the Book Sprint is to produce a book
          in one week, the planning of the event often determines its success. This section details
          some of the planning you should do in advance of the Book Sprint dates. Although a FLOSS
          Manuals Book Sprint uses the FLOSS Manuals wiki tool, you can use this advice with any
          collaborative authoring tool. </p>
        <p>Scope</p>
        <p>What topics will the book cover?</p>
        <p>When determining the <indexterm>content<indexterm>scope of, for Book
            Sprints</indexterm></indexterm>scope of a book, you might experience a “chicken and egg”
          scenario. You might want to plan the scope and then invite people to attend, but at the
          same time you may wonder whether it is better to invite people to attend and then let them
          decide the scope. <indexterm>Hyde, Adam</indexterm>Adam Hyde thinks that you can strike a
          balance. You can decide on the overall topic of a book, such as an existing software
          product, before inviting anyone. The writers participating in the sprint can then help
          brainstorm the details of the content. It’s easier to motivate people if they have input
          early in the process.</p>
        <p>Target Audience</p>
        <p>Along with the scope comes the target audience, and one decision certainly shapes the
          other.</p>
        <p>Who do you want to read the book? What are the job titles they hold? What organizations
          or groups do they belong to? Are they students in a college or industry professionals in
          the workforce? What other publications might they read, or what subject matter should they
          already be familiar with? What is their general level of computer literacy? What operating
          systems are they most commonly using?</p>
        <p>Answering these questions should also help you identify potential participants in the
          Book Sprint as writers, editors, or technicians who can serve as subject matter
          experts.</p>
        <p>Ideally, you can include a person from the target audience in the sprint as a document
          tester. For example, if the target audience is “newbies,” then invite someone who is new
          to the product. Instead of trying to imagine the level at which to write the material, you
          will find more value in having a member of your target audience in the room to look the
          experts in the eye and say “I don’t understand what that means.” The experts may then have
          to recalibrate their tone. This is not to say that the target audience member is always
          right, but the experts have to justify their position when challenged, which leads to
          better content.</p>
        <p>Invitations</p>
        <p>An important first decision when planning an event is whether you will select and invite
          a limited number of attendees or let the attendee list grow by allowing those initially
          invited to invite others<indexterm>invitations to in-person events</indexterm>. After you
          determine your core set of participants, choose a date and location that should work well
          for most of them. After you set a date and location for the core set of participants, you
          can open the event up to others. </p>
        <p>With the FLOSS Manuals OLPC and <indexterm>SugarLabs</indexterm>SugarLabs Book Sprint, we
          had a last-minute request to attend the Book Sprint from a journalist located in the UK.
          Although she didn’t have firsthand experience with the XO laptop, she was interested in
          the <indexterm>One Laptop per Child<indexterm>Book Sprint</indexterm></indexterm>One
          Laptop per Child project and wanted to attend the Book Sprint in order to write a
          freelance journalist article about the experience. Although we were intrigued and
          flattered, we declined her request to attend because we wanted writers who could
          contribute immediately and also wanted to avoid distractions for the other attendees and
          participants. It turned out to be the right decision for all involved since we were a very
          focused group. </p>
        <p>Draw up the outline</p>
        <p>You perform two types of planning for a Book Sprint: planning the content and planning
          the event itself.</p>
        <p>A <indexterm>content<indexterm>topic-oriented</indexterm></indexterm>topic-oriented,
            <indexterm>content<indexterm>single-sourcing</indexterm></indexterm>single-sourcing
          approach to content means that each chapter is a standalone piece of content that can be
          reused in many different remixes. This approach also means that the content can be used in
          a printed book, a PDF file, a collection of browse-able HTML files, or embedded in a
          website as if it were directly created in that web site. Planning with reuse in mind is
          important to the success of the sprint. </p>
        <p>You should choose reusable content that can be completed in the allotted time for the
          Book Sprint. Part of the time spent in a Book Sprint is reusing or rewriting what else has
          been written on the topic. Identifying content that is already written ahead of time is
          part of your planning process. What books, websites, or wikis already discuss the
          technology on which Book Sprint focuses? Can you re-use any of that content based on their
          licensing of the content?</p>
        <p>After you have a proposed audience and scope for a Book Sprint, take the time to talk
          about your ideas with others who are interested in reading the content. Make sure you have
          buy-in for the audience and scope for which you are planning, and revise as necessary
          until you feel ready to start outlining the book. In a few Book Sprints, the outline was
          completed the Sunday just before the week of the sprint.</p>
        <p>Reuse existing content</p>
        <p>After you have created the outline, you should spend time finding as much existing
          content as possible. <indexterm>content<indexterm>reusable</indexterm></indexterm>Re-use,
          re-use, re-use. Search the web and book stores for related content and write to each of
          the authors asking if you can re-use their content. </p>
        <p>If material is available and it is under a liberal license—the same as the one as you
          want to use—ethical and fair treatment of the content means writing to the authors not to
          ask their permission but to ask for their “blessing” or endorsement to re-use the content.
          Many of those authors like to know where their content is re-used, and you might find that
          you have a new, enthusiastic contributor coming on board as the result of your
          communication. At the very least they will probably tell other people about your project
          and that provides good outreach for you.</p>
        <p>Getting existing material is important not just because it can contribute to the total
          content of the book but because it is motivating for the writers to see that some of the
          work has already been done before they start. The writers might throw most of it out but
          by then the content has already had its motivating effect.</p>

      <title>Book Sprint logistics </title>
      <body>
        <p>You need to plan the dates, location, and participants in the sprint before you get very
          far. Either the dates and location are determined by the participants, or who participates
          will determine where and when the event takes place. In either situation, you need to
          consider some basic issues. Location and date selection depend on each other because some
          locations are not going to be available for certain dates. Travel time, distance, and cost
          as well as visa considerations are also part of the equation. If participants need a visa
          to come to the U.S. for such an event, at least a month lead time is necessary. </p>
        <p>Transportation </p>
        <p>How will everyone get there? Will you find the funds for travel or will the participants
          need to cover some or all of their travel expenses themselves? Travel costs are often the
          largest expense. The following sections provide an example of the travel expenses for a
          Book Sprint with about ten to twelve participants in Austin, Texas.</p>
        <p><i>Airfare</i>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Airfare from Amsterdam $1000</li>
          <li>Airfare (for two people) from Boston $800</li>
          <li>Airfare from Wisconsin $400</li>
          <li>Total airfare $2200</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Six additional participants were all within driving distance of Austin. We did not have
          to pay for parking at the host location, and we did not reimburse mileage for driving,
          which would change the total travel costs.</p>
        <p><i>Car rental</i>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Two cars, $100 per for a week, $200 total</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We did not rent cars for this Book Sprint. Driving people around once they were in Austin
          was my duty as a host and logistics coordinator, but we could have rented one or two cars
          (at about $100 each) for the week and made our lives much easier. Good logistics planning
          allows writing to be the focus of the week.</p>
        <p>Location and other venues </p>
        <p>The venue needs to have a single table where everyone can work. The sprinters need ample
          power sockets (or lots of extension cables), and you need a good Internet connection,
          preferably wireless. All-hours access to the building or room itself is helpful. Some host
          locations may want all participants to sign a release so that the host is not liable for
          damage or injury. Signing a release should be fine—nearly all of the planning is based on
          good faith in others anyway, so suing when the location is typically donated would be poor
          form.</p>
        <p><i>Location</i> costs: $0 </p>
        <p>Accommodations </p>
        <p>Where will everyone sleep? Will they pay for their own accommodation or will you find
          funds for it? Is the accommodation sufficiently close to the Book Sprint venue so that
          participants don’t waste energy and time traveling every day? Do heavy snorers, smokers,
          or light sleepers need their own room? Do you need to have a space to prepare and cook
          meals? </p>
        <p>The hotel rate was a corporate rate and in total it was $1333 for five nights with two of
          the rooms shared by four participants. The hotel was within walking distance of the sprint
          location.</p>
        <p>Food </p>
        <p>What is everyone going to eat and who will pay for it? Are there any special food
          requirements? Who is going to make the food? Where will you get the food? Can participants
          get a quick snack and caffeinated beverages as needed? Is everyone comfortable with
          alcohol and if so, what do they drink?</p>
        <p>The best estimate is based on a per diem for the host city. Austin is $38 a day using a
          less expensive corporate rate for example, so the total would be $950 to provide all the
          food.</p>
        <p>Fun </p>
        <p>Is there anything nearby for some fun time out? It’s important to let the <indexterm
              >communities<indexterm>in-person interaction</indexterm></indexterm>team spend time
          together having fun. The Book Sprint is intended to be a fun event that encourages more
          collaborative efforts long after the intense week is done. The event can be as simple as a
          cookout or a hike for some sightseeing. Be sure to incorporate fun into the plan. It’s
          important to allow time for relationship building.</p>

      <title>Book Sprint budget</title>
      <body>
        <p>For the Austin-based Book Sprint, the costs totaled about $5000. We raised money by
          asking for donations from each of the participating organizations (RedHat, <indexterm>One
            Laptop per Child<indexterm>Book Sprint</indexterm></indexterm>OLPC, and <indexterm
            >SugarLabs</indexterm>SugarLabs), and FLOSS Manuals covered the remaining cost.</p>
        <p>The total cost is comparable to hiring a contract technical writer for a specific
          deliverable, yet the results from the collaborative authoring effort generated more
          interest in the projects, and the quality was quite high. </p>

          assuming that Walter could make an email a priority. </p>
        <p>Although extroverts prefer an in-person meeting for authoring documentation, there are

          <li>Offering a strategy for updating and maintaining the documentation because a community

        </ul>
        <p>The community feeling that you build during a Book Sprint project can carry the momentum
          from the project forward, giving people the urge to work on the book in coming weeks and
          leaving them with the feeling they’d like to work together again in the future. It also
          creates evangelists for the projects and generates excitement.</p>
        <p>Remote contributions to a Book Sprint </p>
        <p>Remote participation in a Book Sprint can occur, but it is supplemental to the actual
          event. In the case of the August 2008 FLOSS Manuals Book Sprint, we had a daily conference
          call so that remote participants could report their status and any blocks to their
          writing. We had a constant communication channel open on <indexterm>IRC (Internet Relay
            Chat)</indexterm>IRC (<indexterm>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</indexterm>Internet Relay
          Chat). The founder of FLOSS Manuals, <indexterm>Hyde, Adam</indexterm>Adam Hyde, was
          always available for technical questions in the sprint room, plus the main FLOSS Manuals
          developer Aleksandar <indexterm>Erkalovic, Aleksandar</indexterm>Erkalovic was at the
          ready in Croatia to fix or explain any issues we found while sprinting.</p>
        <p>The experience of the <indexterm>FLOSS Manuals<indexterm>collaborative
              writing</indexterm></indexterm>FLOSS Manuals sprints is that the majority of the work
          occurs in the “real space” of the sprint. There have been exceptions to this. The <i
            >Introduction to the Command Line</i> sprint held in <indexterm>collaboration<indexterm
              >Book Sprints</indexterm></indexterm>collaboration with the Free Software Foundation
          is an example where there were few real-space participants and many remote participants.
          Whichever way the participation is split, remote contributions are very important, and
          it’s absolutely necessary to devise a plan to coordinate the real space and remote
          contributions. </p>
        <p>There are excellent tools for assisting with communication for remote contributors. We
          have used phone conferences (either Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) or “real” phones),
          but in general these are not as effective for ongoing <indexterm>collaboration<indexterm
              >FLOSS Manuals</indexterm></indexterm>collaboration as text-based communication. A
          persistently open text-based chat is good for “ambient” remote communication, and better
          suited for <indexterm>collaboration<indexterm>Book
          Sprints</indexterm></indexterm>collaboration with remote participants over a day, a week,
          or longer. Voice chat seems to put too much focus on immediate activities, and there are
          often dreary moments when participants are trying to think of something to say. </p>
        <p>However, quick conference calls can be very effective to help the real-space Book Sprint
          team realize that they are not working in isolation and that active, real people somewhere
          else on the planet care about what they are doing and want to help. They can give a
          motivating boost but are not absolutely necessary for coordinating work. </p>
        <p>FLOSS Manuals provides the following tools for online communication among contributors: a
          chat widget online, IRC, <indexterm>email<indexterm
          >notifications</indexterm></indexterm>email notifications of changes to a topic, and a
          comparison page showing the changes from one contribution to the next.</p>
        <p>Online chat widget</p>
        <p>To chat with others while contributing to a book, we have provided a little inline chat
          window. You can see it on the right of all pages in the WRITE section of FLOSS Manuals
          website and it is also present in the editing pages. It is a simple mechanism requiring no

          communicating briefly about anything that comes to mind. The text format is short, and
          there is no history or ability to scroll back. The online chat is one chat room; there is
          no provision (yet) for chatting on a book-specific basis. All <indexterm

        <p>IRC is an “old school” technology. Its “Channels” are mainly inhabited by geeks,
          especially free-software geeks. For chat, it’s a good technology because it requires very
          little bandwidth: if you are on a slow connection it works quite well. IRC chat rooms or
          channels are contained within “IRC Networks.” FLOSS Manuals uses the Freenode IRC network,
          one of the oldest and most popular. Anyone can create a chat room on the Freenode network,
          and the FLOSS Manuals chat room most frequently used is #flossmanuals. The web-based chat
          mentioned above connects to that main channel. </p>
        <p>To use the IRC chat rooms, you need to have an IRC client installed or a browser plug-in
          installed. The server information is irc.freenode.net. After you connect to the server,
          you can join a chat room. There are other real-time-chat options available such as
          Campfire and Etherpad. The persistent, synchronous conversations and discussions groups
          can have with these tools are extremely valuable when pulling off a Book Sprint.</p>
        <p>Notifications </p>
        <p>Every book in FLOSS Manuals has an email notification feature and live visual
          notifications of who is editing. By subscribing to <indexterm>email<indexterm
              >notifications</indexterm></indexterm>email notifications, you get email every time a
          change is made in that book. These notifications also link to a “diff” view that shows the
          recent changes and highlights the differences. Both types of notifications are great
          during Book Sprints for keeping an eye on who is doing what. If someone changes something
          you have written, you can see the change and contact them if necessary to discuss the
          change. </p>
        <p>In the editing interface () you can see who is editing any chapter. This view is useful
          for seeing how much activity is going on but it also helps coordinate contributions.</p>

        <p>Think of an Agile development team with an embedded writer, meaning that a team consists
          of developers, designers, testers, and writers. Accomplishing a user story about
          documentation may benefit from the advice given in this section about Book Sprints. The
          entire team may decide to use a wiki and collaborate on a book-like project for an
          iteration. You could use your planning day to outline the deliverable, determine the
          audience, and invite others to share in the fun of accomplishing a book delivery in a
          time-boxed manner.</p>

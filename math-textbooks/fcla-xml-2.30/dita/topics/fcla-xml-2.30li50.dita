<topic id="x51-241000"><title>Chapter LT  Linear Transformations</title><body><p>   In the next linear algebra course you take, the first lecture might be a
reminder about what a vector space is (<xref keyref="fcla-xml-2.30li37/definition.VS">Definition VS</xref>), their ten properties, basic
theorems and then some examples. The second lecture would likely be all about
linear transformations. While it may seem we have waited a long time to present
what must be a central topic, in truth we have already been working with linear
transformations for some time.
</p><p>   Functions are important objects in the study of calculus, but have been absent
from this course until now (well, not really, it just seems that way). In your study
of more advanced mathematics it is nearly impossible to escape the use of
functions — they are as fundamental as sets are.

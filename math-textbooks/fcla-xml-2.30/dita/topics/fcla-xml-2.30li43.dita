<topic id="x44-200000"><title>Chapter D  Determinants</title><body><p>   The determinant is a function that takes a square matrix as an input and
produces a scalar as an output. So unlike a vector space, it is not an algebraic
structure. However, it has many beneficial properties for studying vector spaces,
matrices and systems of equations, so it is hard to ignore (though some have
tried). While the properties of a determinant can be very useful, they are also
complicated to prove.

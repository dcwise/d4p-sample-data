Set up a new sheet with the integers around the edge as before. This time put in d5: '=d4+c4'and copy it into a huge rectangle from d5 to cc100 (say). You should get a huge mass of zeroes. Now set c4 = 1. What do you find?

You should find
<b>"Pascal's Triangle" </b>
or the
<b>binomial coefficients.</b>

<b>Exercise 0.5 Do this and answer the question which is larger, the binomial 
  coefficient C(15,5) or C(14,6)? <ph outputclass="a">Solution</ph>

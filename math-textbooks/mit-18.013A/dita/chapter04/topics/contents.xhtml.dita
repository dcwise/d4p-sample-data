We consider area of a parallelogram and volume of a parallelepiped and the notion of determinant in two and three dimensions, whose magnitudes are these for figures with their column vectors as edges. We then consider the application of matrices to describing linear transformations on vectors, and methods for evaluating determinants.
<br/>
We further discuss the notion of the inverse of a matrix and how it can be computed, and introduce the notions of eigenvalue and charactreristic equation, and the vector or cross product.

    <h1 class="topictitle1">Creating ePub eBooks from DITA XML</h1>

    
    <div><p class="rl_shortdesc">This section explains how to obtain the Dita4Publishers plug-in and create an ePub
        eBook from content written in DITA XML, with the Open Toolkit.</p>

        <div class="p">The prerequisite for this procedure is that you have the Open Toolkit installed and
            running. No other software is required.</div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>If you have content in DITA XML you can create an ePub eBook just like you would
                generate a PDF, XHTML or other output. An ePub eBook is a zip file which is renamed
                with the <span class="parmname">.epub</span> extension. This file contains XHTML content
                files and several other files. The whole package must conform with the ePub
                standard. The plug-in takes care of all of this for you.</p>

        </div>

        <ol><li class="stepexpand">
                <span>Go to <a href="http://dita4publishers.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Dita4Publishers</a> website where you can find all the
                    links and information you need about the plug-in.</span>
                 The ePub plug-in can be downloaded from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dita4publishers/" target="_blank">SourceForge</a> project page.
            </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
                <span>Unzip the downloaded zip file and read the readme file that explains where you
                    should put the plug-in.</span>
                 You should put the contents of the zip in the plug-ins folder of the
                    DITA OT installation.
            </li>
<li class="stepexpand">
                <span>Run the tests as indicated in the readme file. The code is for processing from
                    the Java command line. If you don't know what this is look it up in the DITA
                    Open Toolkit User Guide. Alternatively, you can use Ant to generate your output
                    just like the other OT test examples.</span>
                 You should now have the test output in the default
                        <span class="uicontrol">out</span> folder which is a child of your DITA OT
                    installation. The tests should only take a few seconds to generate. If you want
                    you can make an ePub from some of the other content provided with the OT by
                    pointing the input to a ditamap of choice, for example the Language Reference
                        Guide.<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span>  Generating the Language Reference Guide takes several
                        minutes.</div>

            </li>
</ol>

        <div class="section">You are now ready to create an ePub eBook from any content you may have in DITA XML,
            including content you have in foreign languages. Your ePub eBooks can be viewed on an
            eBook reader device or on your computer with Adobe Digital Editions for
            example.</div>

The following are notes about the ePub output generated with the Open Toolkit ePub         plug-in.</li>

Translating a DITA XML project is fairly straightforward if you have a DITA-aware   translation memory tool and you keep your files well-organised.</li>

This topic shows how some of the DITA elements look in the xhtml output when viewed 		in a browser. Some styling is default but additional CSS styling can create attractive 		effects. </li>

      <title>VERNE'S TITLE</title>
      <p>The French title of this novel is <i
        xml:lang="fr">Vingt mille lieues sous les mers</i>. This is accurately translated as Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the SEAS&#x2014;rather than the SEA, as with many English editions. Verne's novel features a tour of the major oceans, and the term Leagues in its title is used as a measure not of depth but distance. Ed.</p>

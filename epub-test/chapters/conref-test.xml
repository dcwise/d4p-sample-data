  <title>Test of Content Reference</title>
  <body>
    <p>Using content reference to reuse elements that themselves have references
      to other resources, such as images, can be problematic because of the need
      to rewrite pointers. In the case of images, the map-driven processing
      graphic source-to-output map can potentially be thrown off by conref
      because it has to know the source location of the image and that
      information is not clearly maintained in the intermediate files produced
      by the Open Toolkit as of version 1.6.3.</p>
    <p>The main use case is where a conref reuses a &lt;fig> element from a
      topic that is in a different relative location to the image than the
      referencing topic.</p>
    <fig
      conref="reusable-resources/common-figures.xml#subsection-id/fig-0001"/>

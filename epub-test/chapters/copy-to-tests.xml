  <title>Test of Copy-To and Image Resolution</title>
  <body>
    <p>When a topic contains a reference to an image and is involved in copy-to
      based relocation, the final relative path to the image may be wrong if the
      copy-to is not accounted for properly. Bertrand has analyzed the problem
      like so:</p>
    <p>There are different scenarios here:  </p>
    <p>
      <ul
        id="ul_sjg_tc2_23">
        <li>case 1: topic contains an image referenced with the
          <xmlatt>href</xmlatt>:  <ul
          id="ul_nrn_rc2_23">
          <li><xmlatt>xtrf</xmlatt> is the absolute topic path         </li>
          <li><xmlatt>href</xmlatt> is the relative path to the image         
                  </li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>case 2: topic contains an image referenced with the
          <xmlatt>keyref</xmlatt>         <ul
          id="ul_vbp_5c2_23">
          <li><xmlatt>xtrf</xmlatt> is the absolute topic path         </li>
          <li><xmlatt>href</xmlatt> is the relative path to the image</li>
          </ul>                </li>
        <li>case 3: topic contains an image referenced with the
          <xmlatt>keyref</xmlatt> or <xmlatt>href</xmlatt> BUT one topicref
          ancestor referencing the topic has a <xmlatt>copy-to</xmlatt> which
          copies the file to a different location                          <ul
          id="ul_rrh_1d2_23">
          <li><xmlatt>xtrf</xmlatt> is the absolute topic path of the original
            topic         </li>
          <li><xmlatt>href</xmlatt> is the relative path to the image</li>
          </ul>       </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The test case then is to have a parent topic that specifies copy-to and a
      descendant topic that has an image reference. </p>
